<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"><span style='font-weight:normal;'><font size="5">Advantages 
  of This Mediation Service</font></span></font> 
<hr>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Unlike most attorneys, who have dockets ranging from 25-75 cases, I’ve 
  managed as many as 350 files at one time, thus giving me over the experience 
  over the years of handling literally in the vicinity of 3000 files.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> (2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As an attorney who has served as a claim representative both for insurance 
  companies and health care providers for 11 years, I have a much greater understanding 
  as to the issues facing Plaintiff and Defense attorneys, insurance company/self-insured 
  claim representatives, health care providers and the parties themselves, especially 
  as it relates to nursing home, medical malpractice and general liability claims 
  and litigation.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> (3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have evaluated cases from a variety of perspectives over the years, 
  and thus have the ability to overcome the most serious obstacle to resolving 
  multi-defendant litigation, apportioning exposure among the defendants and/or 
  carriers.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> (4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have managed self-insured retentions ranging from $100,000-$3,000,000 
  per occurrence, so I bring expertise in this area to the mediation table as 
  well.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> (5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I will not have any prior experience in litigation with any attorney 
  of any law firm involved in mediation.  As such, I am able to provide truly 
  objective and impartial service, with no past or present “agenda” impacting 
  on my ability to successfully assist the parties in the resolution of their 
  dispute.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> (6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because I am willing to travel outside Atlanta at no expense to the 
  parties, this will insure that all participants to any mediation will have a 
  mediator with a strong understanding of all aspects of nursing home, medical 
  malpractice and general liability, personal injury and wrongful death claims 
  and litigation working with the parties in mediation, regardless of the venue 
  of any particular case.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">(7)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> 
For out of town mediations, there is an average of 4-6 hours (for 2-party mediations), and 6-10 hours (for parties of 3 or more)of pre-mediation preparation, 
consisting of not only a review of submissions, but writing a chronology and analysis of 
the parties strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; When added to the hours of mediation itself, 
in many cases, this results in my rates being much less than local mediators with similar 
background and experience as a mediator. </font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Summary</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Thank you for taking the time to review my web 
  site, to see if my unique mediation service can be of value to you.  Please 
  take a look at the What They Are Saying section, for these attorneys are the 
  best spokespeople as to how the uniqueness of my background and mediation skills 
  enabled them to resolve their cases on behalf of their clients.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">I look forward to the opportunity to provide 
  you with similar mediation service in the future.</font></p>
