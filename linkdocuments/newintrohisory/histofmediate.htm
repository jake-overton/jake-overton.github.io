<p><font size="5" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">History 
  of MediateOne, Inc.</font> 
<hr>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From 1988-1993, 
  I managed claims and litigation in Houston on behalf of 2 insurance companies 
  that insured physicians, nursing homes, psychologists, blood banks, funeral 
  homes, and other miscellaneous health care providers.  I also managed claims 
  and litigation on behalf of a Third Party Administrator, where my clients were 
  self-insured hospitals.  I also worked for a major insurance broker,<b> </b>developing 
  a claim department for a national self-insured acute care provider.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From 1994-1999, 
  I built self-insured claim departments, ranging from $100,000-$3,000,000 per 
  occurrence<b> </b>for 4 national health care companies,<b> </b>providing services 
  in acute care hospitals, physician practice management, nursing homes and psychiatric 
  hospitals.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This experience 
  afforded me the opportunity to travel throughout the country, negotiating settlements, 
  with full knowledge that only 2%–3% of all cases eventually go to trial.  From 
  1988-1999, I was involved in literally thousands of cases involving virtually<b> 
  </b>every type of health care provider there is.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of 
  the things that intrigued me about settling cases was the development of mediation<b> 
  </b>as a tool to be utilized to successfully resolve cases.&nbsp; </font><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Having 
  negotiated settlements on behalf of 2 insurance companies, a third party administrator, 
  an insurance broker, and 4 national self-insured corporations, I have developed 
  a mediation service that allows all litigants to take advantage of my unique 
  background as an attorney who spent 11 years on the “front burner” negotiating 
  settlements of nursing home, medical malpractice and general liability, personal 
  injury and wrongful death cases to assist them in the amicable resolution of 
  their claims and lawsuits prior to trial.</font></p>
