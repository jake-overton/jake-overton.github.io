<hr>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><o:p></o:p></font> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">My first experience with acute care hospital claims and litigation management was in 1990, when I was Senior Litigation Supervisor for Dynamark, a TPA that was a subsidiary of the Johnson &amp; Higgins brokerage firm.  My clients were self-insured hospitals, including Columbia Healthcare Corporation's first hospitals in El Paso, Texas.  I performed all of the traditional claims and litigation management functions for these facilities.  In 1993, I served as Columbia's Corporate Claims Manager, while an employee of Healthcare Insurance Services, a division of The Galtney Group in Houston.  This involved developing a claim program and philosophy for Columbia's 25 hospitals, most of which were located in Texas and Florida.  In 1994, I moved to Nashville, to bring &quot;in-house&quot;, the claim program of OrNda Healthcorp.  This involved 50 hospitals in about 15 states, with a heavy concentration of these facilities being located in Texas, Florida and California (approximately 15 facilities in Los Angeles and Orange Counties).  We were self-insured for $3,000,000 per occurrence, and I personally managed Texas, Florida and California, before hiring a Claim Manager in Long Beach, California, who I trained by spending one week a month with her for one year.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">In terms of my experience with acute care hospitals, I have managed hundreds of claims, settled many claims on my own, or through authority granted to defense counsel, or via mediation.  I have dealt with nuisance value slip and falls and multi-million dollar &quot;bad baby&quot; cases in Los Angeles, Houston and Miami, as well as serious exposures in other dangerous venues.  I actually worked in a hospital for one week each year at OrNda with the Risk Manager, so I could learn more about hospital operations and risk management from a more local perspective.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">I don't think any other mediators bring this experience to the mediation table.<br></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">In 1998, I was Vice President of Risk Management at Behavioral Healthcare Corporation, a company of 43 psychiatric hospitals in about 15-16 states.  Many of these facilities were located in both the Bay Area and Southern California, and as the only person in the risk management department, I managed all the claims and litigation, thus I am intimately familiar with the issues relative to evaluating these exposures.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">PHYSICIANS</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">From 1988-1990, I was a Claims Attorney for Insurance Corporation of America, a physician carrier based in Houston.  I literally handled 375 claims/lawsuits at a time, primarily in Texas.  In 1997, I served as Vice President of Claims at MedPartners in Birmingham.  At the time, this company was the largest physician practice management company in the country, with physician practices in over 40 states, including a large presence in Southern California through the state's largest physician practice, Mullikin Medical Group out of Long Beach, where MedPartners' Western Division was headquartered.  I managed much of this litigation, and supervised Claim Managers in Long Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Chicago.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">LONG TERM CARE</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">In the early 1990's, I served as a Claims Manager for a surplus lines carrier in Houston that insured many Texas nursing homes.  In the late 1990's, I served as Director of Claims for Mariner Post-Acute Network, a provider of over 430 facilities in over 35 states, including 100 facilities in Texas, 60-70 in Florida and 30-40 in California, representing three of the most volatile jurisdictions in the country for long term care litigation.  I have mediated nursing home cases pursuant to 4 Texas bankruptcies, Texas Health Enterprises, Harvest Communities, Heart of Texas and Autumn Hills, as well as having mediated these cases in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington State, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">To my knowledge, I am the only mediator in the country who has worked for both an insurance carrier and nursing home provider mediating these complex cases.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">SUMMARY</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Over the years, I have been fortunate enough to evaluate probably a couple of thousand claims from many different perspectives, for insurance companies, a TPA and 4 health care providers.  This gives me a unique insight as to any case, especially when there are multiple defendants, for in these cases, the biggest dispute often isn't the value of the case, it's apportioning exposure among the co-defendants. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">I would submit to you there are no attorney/mediators anywhere such as myself that can offer you this level of expertise in healthcare.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">If you have any questions or concerns, or need any additional information regarding my background in these areas, I would invite you to contact me at (866) 629-4433.<br>
