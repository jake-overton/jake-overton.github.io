<p>ISSUE</p>
<p>How much will it cost to utilize you as mediator?&nbsp; Who is going to pay for your time and expenses relative to travel? Why would we use you out of Atlanta, if we have plenty of local mediators where our cases are?</p>
<p>FACT</p>
<p>The <a href="../newfees/feesstruct.htm">Fee Structure</a> section addresses fees, depending on the state where the case is to be mediated.&nbsp; Regardless of jurisdiction, the Fee Structure offers a very competitive rate that represents less than the cost of 1 deposition.&nbsp; Please note, I am responsible for my travel time and expenses, so this will not serve as a deterrent to anyone wishing to utilize my services. </p>
<p>The reason my service can be of much greater value than other mediators is that from 1988-1999, I was involved in probably 2000 medical malpractice cases involving nursing homes, hospitals, physicians, labs, clinics, and other miscellaneous healthcare providers.&nbsp; As a former claims person, from 1988-1999, all I  did was strategize how cases could be settled.&nbsp; That’s exactly what mediation is all about, developing strategy for putting parties in a position to settle   their disputes for sums that all parties can live with.&nbsp; In addition, having managed national claim programs, it is easier to familiarize oneself with state  statutes relative to a particular case, than it is to learn an industry, such as long term care, hospital negligence, physician malpractice, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have mediated thus far in any of the cities and states listed in the <a href="../../mediated.htm">Places Mediated</a> link, and I anticipate it won’t be 
	regarding future cases scheduled in any other state where my services are requested.</p>
	<p>SOLUTION</p>
	<p>Since I am picking up the travel time and expense myself, it is just a matter of allowing me with my experience in all aspects of long term care, medical malpractice and personal injury litigation as well as mediation to work with the respective parties toward resolving 
  their dispute.</p>

	<p>ISSUE</p>
	<p>If you’re picking up the travel time and expense yourself, how far will you travel to mediate our cases?</p>
	<p>FACT</p>
<p>The Fee Structure includes travel to anywhere in the country.&nbsp; All cases outside Atlanta are mediated on a flat fee basis, with no charge for travel time and expense.&nbsp; Discounts are given to all parties for multiple Defendant cases. Please refer to the <a href="../newfees/feesstruct.htm">Fee Structure</a> page for a listing of fees by region.</p>
<p>SOLUTION</p>
	<p>If you have a case, wherever it might be, where you believe my experience would be of benefit to all parties in attempting to resolve the dispute, please let me know. Don’t assume that geography is an issue to me, because it is not.</p>

<p><a name="location"><u>LOCATION OF MEDIATION</u></a></p>
	<p>ISSUE</p>
	<p>Since you don’t have offices in every city, where do you mediate your cases outside of Atlanta?</p>
	<p>FACT</p>
	<p>Flying from Atlanta to mediate a case in the offices of either plaintiff attorneys or defense attorneys has not been an impediment to parties wishing to utilize my services.&nbsp; I have successfully mediated cases in both plaintiff and defense attorney offices, and when compared to the cases I have mediated in Atlanta, I have seen no difference in how the mediation transpired, nor can I say an outcome would have been any different by virtue of where the mediation was held.</p>
	<p>Other mediators I have talked to who have mediated in the offices of plaintiff and/or defense attorneys also have seen no difference in their outcomes.</p>
	<p>SOLUTION</p>
<p>Offer to mediate the dispute in plaintiff counsel’s office.&nbsp; If the parties cannot agree on mediating the case at plaintiff counsel’s office, offer to mediate the dispute at defense counsel’s office.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the parties cannot agree on mediating the case at defense counsel’s office, court reporting firms’ office space or hotel conference rooms can be utilized to mediate the dispute.</p>
