<p>I recently participated in a mediation handled by Richard Strauss.&nbsp; Richard was recommended by Co-Defendant's counsel.&nbsp; The case involved an alleged product defect in a medical device and also involved complex medical causation issues.</p>
<p>This was my first experience with Richard.&nbsp; I found him to be very well prepared and knowledgeable of the subject matter.&nbsp; His approach to mediation was thorough and respectful, but evaluative.&nbsp; The case settled at mediation.</p>
<p>Based upon my experience, I would recommend Richard in cases of this nature in the future.</p>

<p>On December 8, 2004, Richard Strauss assisted me in mediating a complicated and contentious nursing home medical malpractice and wrongful death case in Birmingham, Alabama.&nbsp; The resident had multiple unsupervised falls over a brief residency culminating in her death.&nbsp; At the time we went to mediation, the case was on appeal before the Alabama Supreme Court regarding the enforceability of the arbitration clause in the admissions agreement.&nbsp; No depositions had been taken but both sides had experts armed to discuss the standard of care and causation.</p>
<p>Richard did a good job of diffusing the anger in the room during his opening statements.&nbsp; He not only explained the procedural intricacies of mediation but helped the estate representative understand that this was an opportunity to close a very painful chapter in her life.&nbsp; It was telling that the initial conference with the claimant lasted almost an hour as the estate representative was able to vent her frustrations, concerns, and grief about the incident.&nbsp; Once this emotion was discharged, the case was much closer to a resolution.&nbsp; Beyond fostering a conciliatory atmosphere at the mediation, Richard was able to draw on his background in nursing home risk management and nursing home claims adjusting to analyze the substantive issues presented.&nbsp; Very frequently, plaintiffs do not understand the true mechanics of a nursing home and have expectations that the case provided with rival that of a hospital.&nbsp; Richard was able to answer their questions about nursing homes in general and address the meaningful medical issues presented in our case.&nbsp; The parties provided medical summaries and position statements prior to the mediation and he evidenced a comprehensive knowledge of the file during negotiations.&nbsp; This allowed us not only to settle the case but to settle the case without wasting an undue amount of time.</p>
<p>Medical malpractice claims, especially nursing home claims, are difficult files to resolve.&nbsp; The difficulty factor is increased when the claim also involves wrongful death.&nbsp; Richard's background with nursing homes was critical, in my opinion, to getting this matter resolved.&nbsp; He was able to offer different options to the parties throughout all stages of negotiations and ultimately we resolved a case that I anticipated I would be living with for a few more years.</p>

<p align="left">Mr. Strauss mediated a matter for me in Birmingham, Alabama...&nbsp; It is a tribute to Richard's hard work and effectiveness that this matter was resolved later in the week.&nbsp; The lawsuit which Mr. Strauss mediated was a nursing home malpractice case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Judge ordered the case to mediation prior to the onset of significant discovery.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss' expert knowledge in the administration of acute and long-term care facilities and the handling of claims of malpractice against each type of facility was of invaluable assistance to the resolution of this matter.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss has the ability to relate in a very effective manner with insurance adjusters due to his past experience as an adjuster for cases involving acute and long-term care matters.</p>

<p>Please let the following serve as a recommendation for Richard Strauss, a mediator with whom we recently worked to resolve a nursing home negligence case...&nbsp; We found Mr. Strauss to be extremely focused and well-prepared to initiate the mediation proceeding...&nbsp; It was obvious that he had thoroughly reviewed the materials submitted to him prior to the mediation.&nbsp; He had an excellent working knowledge of the legal issues, as well an understanding of the medical issues of this particular claim.&nbsp; Our case had been pending for several years and numerous depositions had been taken...&nbsp; Mr. Strauss' approach to the mediation stripped the case right down to the simplest terms, and he was able to focus both parties on their respective strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that with Mr. Strauss' assistance and negotiating skills, we were able to bring the case to a resolution.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss demonstrated excellent skills and ability to work with the attorneys and their clients.&nbsp; We would be pleased to work with him again in mediation.</p>

<p>I recently had an opportunity to mediate a nursing home wrongful death case with Richard Strauss...&nbsp; The plaintiff submitted an exorbitant demand prior to the mediation...&nbsp; Nonethless, the parties agreed to mediate and selected Richard as our mediator.</p>
<p>As a result of Richard's unique background in the long term care industry he was able to immediately recognize and focus on the central issues in the case.&nbsp; Because Richard has worked with both plaintiff and defense lawyers, he could objectively analyze the issues and identify risks to both parties if the case ultimately went to trial.&nbsp; In a case with poor settlement prospects, Richard was able to bring the parties to an ultimate resolution that was satisfactory to both sides.</p>
<p>Not only did I find Richard's expertise and knowledge helpful during this process, the cost of Richard's services were also very reasonable.&nbsp; My client was not only very satisfied with the outcome but also with the costs for the result which was ultimately achieved.</p>
<p>I am pleased to recommend Richard and urge you to consider him for mediations in the future.</p>
