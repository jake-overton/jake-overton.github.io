<p>We recently successfully mediated a medical malpractice case. &nbsp;I represented one defendant. &nbsp;Plaintiff's counsel as well as defense counsel agreed upon Richard Strauss as the mediator based on prior successful experience with him. &nbsp;Simply stated, Mr. Strauss comes recommended by both defense and plaintiff's counsel. &nbsp;His extensive experience in the area of medical malpractice and his thorough preparation and understanding of the key issues presented during mediation were major factors in resolving the case.</p>
<p>Throughout mediation his observations, suggestions, and various options were instrumental in moving the case to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>Richard is an individual who we will definitely use in future medical malpractice mediations.</p>

<p>Since 1976 I have concentrated my practice in civil litigation, primarily as a defense attorney.&nbsp; For the last twenty years the majority of my practice has been the defense of medical malpractice cases.</p>
<p>I recently had an opportunity to mediate a case with Richard Strauss of MediateOne.&nbsp; He was recommended to us by plaintiff's counsel.&nbsp; Ordinarily such a recommendation would give me pause for concern.&nbsp; However, after meeting Mr. Strauss and going through the mediation, any hesitation I had was quickly dispelled.</p>
<p>I have never mediated a case with an individual that had a better understanding of the medical and legal issues that were presented in our case.&nbsp; It was apparent that Mr. Strauss had done his homework.&nbsp; He understood the medical issues, in some cases better than my opponent.</p>
<p>Both parties trusted Mr. Strauss with their confidences and relied upon his judgment and analysis of the issues in the case.&nbsp; He offered many different options for us to consider in our attempts to settle the case and ultimately narrowed the parties' positions considerably after a long day's effort.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the case did not settle on the date mediated but Mr. Strauss continued the efforts afterwards over a period of several months ultimately successfully concluding the case.</p>
<p>To say we were satisfied with his effort is an understatement.&nbsp; The fact that I have engaged him again to serve as a mediator in complicated malpractice cases and have recommended him to my colleagues reflects my confidence in his skills as a mediator.</p>
<p>I welcome any questions that attorneys might have concerning Mr. Strauss' mediation services.</p>

<p>I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you again for your considerable efforts in helping us resolve the...&nbsp;litigation during our recent mediation in Huntington, West Virginia.</p>
<p>As you know, a large part of my legal practice is comprised of defending nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in cases involving alleged medical negligence, violations of residents' rights, and related breach of contract and punitive damage claims.&nbsp; Over the past several years, I have participated in numerous mediations around the country with usually good results, but found your role in this matter especially impressive.</p>
<p>Both my client and I were very pleased with your level of background knowledge in long-term care issues, as well as the level of preparation you brought to our particular case.&nbsp; As I believe I mentioned after the mediation, the fact that you did not have to be &quot;educated&quot; during the mediation about the allegations and the details of the resident's care made the negotiations move considerably smoother.&nbsp; Also, I think your ready knowledge of the facts and often rather minute details gave added weight and gravity to your recommendations to the respective parties.</p>
<p>I also appreciated your good humor and ability to keep the parties negotiating in a positive manner, even during the more rancorous liability debates.&nbsp; Finally, I believe your deft handling of the rather unique personalities of some of the <i>attorneys'</i> involved is probably what finally got this case resolved, instead of ending in a costly stalemate.</p>
<p>In any event, thank you again for your hard work during our recent mediation.&nbsp; I look forward to working with you again in the near future.</p>

<p>You did a terrific job and it was evident you worked very hard to get our case resolved.&nbsp; After our initial mediation  back in 2013, I recommended you to several attorneys- both plaintiff and defendant.&nbsp; Your understanding of the issues and preparation in that case and the most recent case were impressive.&nbsp; The post-mediation work you did was just as impressive but also demonstrated the work you're willing to put in to see a resolution.&nbsp; That puts you in an elite class in my opinion.&nbsp; You'll be working with us again and your name will remain at the top of a short list of mediators who I'm pleased to refer to colleagues.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your efforts today.&nbsp; I admit that I was quite skeptical coming into this mediation as to whether we could get it done.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your very diligent preparation, your expertise, and for utilization of your imagination/magic.&nbsp; I enjoyed the tutorial on brackets, and admired the way you used them effectively.</p>
<p>It was nice to work together again.</p>

<p align="left">I had the pleasure of mediating a case with Richard Strauss on July 31, 2015.&nbsp; I was skeptical, based on other experiences, of having an out-of-state mediator come to central Illinois.&nbsp; I was very pleased with Mr. Strauss as our mediator.&nbsp; He was well prepared, communicative, and effective.&nbsp; I would not hesitate to use him again.</p>
