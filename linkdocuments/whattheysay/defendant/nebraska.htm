	<p>I had the pleasure of working with Richard Strauss as a mediator in two matters recently and I want to provide this letter as a letter of recommendation.&nbsp; Richard's expertise, professionalism and dedication are second-to-none.&nbsp; He works with all parties to see if he can get a fair and just resolution to put matters behind all parties and to heal.&nbsp; Richard's techniques and mannerisms lend greatly to his success.</p>
	<p>I recommend him highly.</p>
