<p>Richard was recommended to us by our client, to mediate a dispute pertaining to water damage involving a first party insurance claim.&nbsp; There were a number of legal issues in the case and Richard arrived well versed in all of them, able, accordingly,to contribute to a discussion of the issues.&nbsp; His demeanor was excellent and he continually channeled the parties in the right direction.&nbsp; At the end, when it seemed as though we would be at an impasse, Richard came up with some new suggestions which ultimately settled the case.</p>
