	<p>I wanted to provide you this email if you would like to use me as a reference.&nbsp; You have my complete approval to do so.&nbsp; You did a wonderful job on our case.&nbsp; You were prepared, and you knew the medicine.&nbsp; You also work well with all the personalities in the room.&nbsp; I do not believe we would have had the same success without you.</p>

<p>Dear Richard,</p>
<p>I have been meaning to write this for months.&nbsp; This follows the double-header mediation we had earlier this year in Philadelphia.&nbsp; I was very pleased that we were able to resolve both cases, each a significant case, each with very capable plaintiff's counsel.</p>
<p>Although my office had worked with you years earlier, in these recent matters, you came recommended by plaintiff's counsel.&nbsp; It was expected (and we were not disappointed), that you had a thorough working knowledge of the facts within the mediation memos, particularly the clinical records, as well as the procedural and evidentiary issues.&nbsp; Your level of preparation is as good as anyone I have ever worked with as a mediator.&nbsp; Your experience in long term care also places the participants in the mediation on notice that their position, or their exposure, and/or their demands, will be evaluated in the context of that experience.</p>
<p>I thought your approach with both sides of the table was effective, whether speaking to a grieving or angry family member, or having some frank discussion with the industry representative.</p>
<p>Of course, the bottom line is always, did  we get the case resolved, and was the mediation that got us to that point effective, and cost effective.&nbsp; I can certainly say 'yes' to those questions.</p>
<p>Thank you for your able assistance.&nbsp; I look forward to working with you again.&nbsp; Please do not hesitate to use me as a reference.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>

<p>Please accept this correspondence as my recommendation for Richard Strauss' services as a mediator. &nbsp;I am a practicing attorney who serves as 
	national counsel to an insurer of a nursing home chain.&nbsp; In that capacity, I have had occasion to utilize Mr. Strauss' services as a mediator 
	in several matters.&nbsp; I have found Mr. Strauss to be extremely effective in assisting the parties in resolving their differences in these 
	cases.&nbsp; He consistently demonstrates a working knowledge of the facts absed upon written submissions received from counsel. &nbsp;He provides 
	insight and thoughtfulness when presenting opposing points of view.&nbsp; I believe that his background and experience working with nursing 
	homes and insurance carriers equips him with an unique perspective that is invaluable to the mediation process.&nbsp; I would highly recommend 
	Richard as a mediator to any attorney or party interested in resolving their case.&nbsp; In my opinion, he is among the best mediators I have 
	ever had the pleasure of working with.</p>
