<p>My first encounter with Richard Strauss as a mediator came as the result of him being recommended by the insurance company.&nbsp; The parties chose him for the most recent mediation at the request of Plaintiff's counsel.&nbsp; Therefore, Richard is unique in that he has the respect of both sides.</p>
<p>My practice areas are mainly in the defense of long term care facilities and medical malpractice. &nbsp;I would not hesitate to use Richard again as a mediator. &nbsp;He really has the long term care cases down to a science. &nbsp;He has the innate ability to understand and appreciate the issues from both sides. &nbsp;It was clear in my recent mediation that he had taken the time to read the pre-mediation packets submitted to him by the parties and was keenly aware of the issues involved. &nbsp;As such, it was not necessary spending multiple rounds in the mediation just to educate him.</p>
<p>Richard is able to objectively analyze the issues and identify risks to both parties. &nbsp;At the end of the day, we were able to settle our case at the mediation.&nbsp; I do not believe this would have been possible without Richard's skills. &nbsp;I look forward to working with him again in the future.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to use Richard Strauss as a mediator for a long-term care dispute in South Carolina in May, 2015.&nbsp;  recommended by our claim representative, who was well-acquainted with Richard's experience in mediating these types of cases.</p>

<p>I found Richard's level of preparation and understanding of the key issues of the case to be outstanding.&nbsp; His competency was aided in no small part due to his extensive background in the long-term care and claim handling field.</p>

<p>Richard's unique approach to mediation was extremely helpful in our case.&nbsp; He proposed, and we accepted, to forego opening statements by either side in order to create a conciliatory environment which was key in resolving our case.&nbsp; Moreover, he had helpful and novel suggestions and tools to bridge a rather large gap between the starting positions of both sides in our case.&nbsp; Finally, and most importantly, he was able to successfully resolve the case at mediation.&nbsp; I would whole-heartedly recommend Richard for any future mediations in the fields of medical malpractice and long term care.</p>
