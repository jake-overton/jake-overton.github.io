<p> I write to provide my strong recommendation for using Richard M. Strauss, Esq., as a mediator in any complex personal injury or medical malpractice case.</p>
<p> 
  I have used Richard on more than one occasion, and have found him to be incredibly prepared, professional and effective.&nbsp; Richard's unique background in medical malpractice, long-term care and personal injury litigation is extremely well-suited to any lawyer who represents a client involved in such a case.&nbsp; Richard also pours a great deal of time into preparing for his mediations.&nbsp; He has an excellent command of the facts of the case, regardless of its particular complexities, and the relationship between co-defendants, to the extent there are multiple defendants in a case.&nbsp; The tone he sets in his opening comments create an atmosphere of resolution, and I sincerely believe that he is able to see cases through to resolution that might not otherwise be resolved.&nbsp; Richard's dedication to mediation, his high talent level, and his reasonable fees (including no charges for travel expenses) make him the perfect choice in any complex matter.</p>
<p>I would be delighted to discuss my experiences with Richard should you have any particular questions. </p>
