<p> I have had the pleasure of working with Richard M. Strauss, Esquire, as a Mediator.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss is an attorney well versed in long-term care, medical malpractice, personal injury litigation and mediation, and I found him to be extremely effective and diligent as a mediator.&nbsp; I found Mr. Strauss to be very knowledgeable and able to objectively analyze the issues of the case, and able to identify the risks to both parties, which effectively led to a resolution of the dispute we mediated together.&nbsp; I would be pleased to be able to mediate other cases with Mr. Strauss in the future.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Mr. Strauss is such a strong mediator is his background in the field.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss has experience in handling claims for a large national nursing home chain.&nbsp; This background makes him uniquely qualified to understand the key issues in a long-term care case.&nbsp; However, his expertise is not limited to long-term care.</p>
<p>I was greatly impressed by Mr. Strauss' level of preparation and understanding of the issues in the case which we mediated together.&nbsp; He was well versed in all aspects of the litigation and knew, in great detail, the facts of the case.&nbsp; His opening comments were specifically directed toward creating a conciliatory environment necessary for the compromise and resolution of the claim.&nbsp; His approach was to have a thorough discussion and analysis of the issues in the case with each side, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of each party's case.&nbsp; Throughout the process, he was willing to offer options and suggestions to facilitate the mediation and negotiations.</p>
<p>I believe that Mr. Strauss would be able to effectively mediate a case, whether it be a nursing home case, medical malpractice case, or other personal injury case, regardless of the jurisdiction or venue, and regardless of the differences in style or opinions of opposing counsel.&nbsp; He is quite effective at bringing the two sides together to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>I hope to be able to mediate additional cases with Mr. Strauss in the near future.&nbsp; I would highly recommend Mr. Strauss as a mediator and would be happy to discuss my experience with Mr. Strauss should you need further information.</p>
