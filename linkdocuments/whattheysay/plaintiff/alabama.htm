  <hr class="main-hr">
  <p>I want to commend you on an outstanding job at the mediation of...&nbsp;Your
    hard work helped us to work through some difficult issues and I was extremely
    impressed not only with your knowledge and grasp of the legal issues, but your
    obvious experience with some of the medical issues, as well. &nbsp;I have
    already recommended you to my partners at this firm for future mediations.</p>
  <p>Please feel free to convey a copy of this letter to other attorneys and advise
    them I will be happy to speak with them if they have no experience with you as
    a mediator. &nbsp;Some points I think were very positive about your services
    are: (1) That you were certainly willing to come to Birmingham with no charge
    for travel; (2) While this was our first mediation together, and I understood
    that you had worked with the defense attorney, our research regarding your
    services as a mediator with other plaintiff's counsel was extremely positive;
    (3) While your background certainly appears to be more defense oriented, you
    were very objective in looking at both the strengths and weaknesses of both
    sides of the case; (4) My clients had a great deal of respect for your opinions
    and, for the first time in a long time, I felt very comfortable letting the
    mediator speak directly with my clients about certain sensitive issues; (5)
    You certainly have strengths in healthcare issues, especially nursing home
    issues and I believe this greatly contributed to the resolution of this case;
    (6) Finally, your flat fee service was very competitive and, given your experience
    in nursing home issues, was actually a bargain.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, Richard is able to effectively communicate with the attorneys
    and parties about how the issues and factors presented affect the value of the
    case.&nbsp; My clients have all been very impressed with Richard's demeanor and
    fair
    approach to the mediation of their cases.&nbsp; They have all commented that
    Richard's ability to communicate with them concerning both the strong and weak
    points of their cases aided them in making the difficult decisions involved
    in resolving their cases.</p>

  <p>Richard Strauss served as a mediator in a nursing home/medical malpractice
    case that I handled in Macon County, Georgia.&nbsp; I highly recommend Richard
    Strauss as a mediator in these types of cases.&nbsp; He was knowledgable and
    well informed about the nursing home industry and nursing home litigation.</p>
  <p>Both sides submitted pre-mediation statements, along with pleadings and other
    documents.&nbsp; It was obvious that Richard had studied all submissions from
    both sides, prior to the mediation, and had a clear understanding of the issues
    upon which the mediation would turn.</p>
  <p> From the beginning of the mediation until the end of the mediation, at which
    time the case was settled, Richard energetically pressed both sides to continue
    with negotiations, while at the same time offering helpful analysis and suggestions
    regarding settlement strategies.&nbsp; Lastly, our client was very pleased with
    Richard and felt comfortable with him throughout the mediation.&nbsp; At one point
    during the mediation, we asked Richard to meet with our client outside of our
    presence, which was very helpful in advancing the case toward ultimate resolution.</p>
  <p> I believe that Richard is very capable of mediating cases across jurisdictional
    lines due to his acute familiarity with the nursing home industry and litigation
    all over the country.&nbsp; I would highly recommend Richard Strauss as a mediator.</p>

  <p>We had the pleasure of working with Richard Strauss in mediating our case of...
    &nbsp;Although we had never worked with Mr. Strauss before, I was very impressed
    with the effort he had put into preparing for mediation and his knowledge of the
    very complicated medical issues that were involved in our case.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss
    displayed exceptional knowledge not only of the particular facts of our case,
    but of nursing home cases in general.&nbsp; He was extremely thorough, fair,
    and offered insightful neutral opinions at critical points during the mediation.</p>

  <p>Mr. Richard M. Strauss conducted a mediation whereby my client was the
    Plaintiff.&nbsp; He did an <u>excellent</u> job.&nbsp; Although Mr. Strauss'
    background is in the defense insurance industry, he was not only fair and
    likeable to my client, but seemed to be able to talk the right language to the
    other side to help get the matter settled.&nbsp; I strongly recommend Mr. Strauss
    as a mediator, and most particularly as regards mediation regarding nursing
    homes generally.</p>

  <p>My law practice is limited to personal injury and death cases.&nbsp; In a
    recent case alleging wrongful death under the Alabama Medical Liability Act,
    the defense attorney suggested Richard Strauss as a mediator.&nbsp; I must
    admit that after reviewing his background I was somewhat skeptical, but after
    meeting and working with Richard I realized my concerns were unwarranted.</p>
  <p>Richard brought a unique and fresh perspective to our case.&nbsp; His background
    in the medical arena was most helpful to both sides.&nbsp; He objectively and
    impartially analyzed issues and identified risks and concerns pertinent to all
    parties.</p>
  <p>We successfully mediated our case and I look forward to using Richard in the future.</p>

  <p>I recently had the pleasure of working with Richard in a successful mediation
    regarding an automobile accident in Georgia that resulted in severe injuries
    to my client.&nbsp; Richard was able to digest all of the factual issues of
    the accident, as well as understand the intricate details of my client's injuries,
    and therefore, had an early grasp on damages in this case.&nbsp; In my opinion,
    it was Richard's ability to get an early grasp on all of the facts and the
    damages in this case that allowed us to ultimately resolve our case.</p>
  <p>Richard also drew from his previous experience from working with insurance
    carriers and in-house counsel in such a manner so as to have both credibility
    and persuasiveness in dealing with the defendants in the case.&nbsp; I also
    found it greatly beneficial in our particular case that Richard was willing
    to travel to the plaintiff's hometown in Alabama to mediate this case at no
    additional expense.</p>
  <p>In my opinion, Richard is very effective in mediating difficult and complex
    cases successfully.&nbsp; I wholeheartedly recommend Richard as a mediator.</p>

  <p>Recently this law firm had the experience of working with Richard Strauss as
    mediator in a nursing home wrongful death case.&nbsp; This law firm concentrates
    its work in plaintiff's matters only.&nbsp; Our work includes commercial cases,
    catastrophic injury, workers' compensation, products liability, toxic torts, etc.</p>
  <p>It may seem incongruent but it is our preference in selecting mediators that
    the mediator come from the defense side of the bar.&nbsp; Experience has taught
    us that unless the viability of our claim is recognized by the carrier's
    representative, the mediation is futile.&nbsp; Consequently, it is important
    that the mediator with the insurance person.&nbsp; The opinions of retired
    judges and certainly former or current members of the plaintiff's bar rarely
    have the needed influence on those who make the ultimate decision for the defendant.</p>
  <p>When Richard Strauss' name was presented by the defense as a potential mediator,
    I was pleased to learn of his great experience in handling nursing home cases
    defense and nursing home perspective.&nbsp; I had no doubt that his opinions
    would be given weight by the defense in our mediation.&nbsp; My only concern
    was whether or not he, coming into our locality, would be acquainted with the
    demographics of our area.&nbsp; Additionally, I was concerned that he might
    not be informed as to what might be expected both from my law firm or jurors
    when presented a case such as the one he was to mediate.&nbsp; Any misgivings
    I had were resolved early.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss endeavored himself to acquaint
    himself with all contestants, the parties, the area, and the potential for
    the case in the context of all the foregoing.&nbsp; The result was a fair
    and reasonable settlement at a fair and reasonable mediation cost.</p>
  <p>Having been through this process with Mr. Strauss, I can attest to his work
    ethic, integrity, abilities, and qualifications, and I recommend him to you
    should your need for mediation fall within his area of expertise.&nbsp; If
    you have additional questions concerning a potential mediation with Mr. Strauss
    and wish to explore my experience with him further, you may call at the above
    number.</p>

  <p>Richard's objective analysis of the facts and his unique background with respect
    to acute and long term care were very significant in bringing this case to a
    resolution.&nbsp; Richard also demonstrated a healthy stubbornness in refusing
    to declare a stalemate in the mediation process, so long as there remained the
    slightest chance of settlement.</p>

  <p>I just wanted to write and thank you for your hard work on the recent group
    of cases we settled.&nbsp; I sincerely appreciate willingness to address a
    task of this size and difficulty.</p>
  <p>I am always amazed at how prepared you are on the actual facts of the case.&nbsp;
    I have had several mediations where the mediator took up half the day just
    trying to learn the issues of the case.&nbsp; It is absolutely essential that
    a mediator know the issues, including the strengths and weaknesses of the case,
    prior to mediation in order to be able to intelligently address the key points
    in the case.&nbsp; Your long-term care experience enables you to do this in an
    efficient manner which benefits all parties.</p>
  <p>I appreciate your hard work during the mediation.&nbsp; As opposed to just
    carrying numbers back and forth, you are always ready to discuss the actual
    facts.&nbsp; Additionally, my clients commented on how well you conveyed the
    issues to them in a practical manner.&nbsp; Your ability to sift through the
    myriad of insurance and medical issues is a great asset on any complex case.</p>
  <p>I also want to thank you for your willingness to travel (at no expense to
    the parties) in order to allow us to work out this group settlement.&nbsp; With
    the number of attorneys, insurance adjusters and other logistical problems,
    this was the only way this could have been accomplished.&nbsp; Your ability
    to travel to a particular venue is always of great benefit to all parties.</p>
  <p>Again, I just wanted to thank you for your efforts, and I look forward to
    working with you again in the near future.</p>

  <p>I am an attorney who practices plaintiff's nursing home and medical malpractice.
    &nbsp; I have had the privilege of utilizing the services of Richard Strauss
    as a mediator on several cases.&nbsp; Prior to becoming a plaintiff's attorney, I
    practiced for eight years on the defense side.&nbsp; Thus, I have a very keen
    understanding of the importance of an objective yet very hardnosed mediator.</p>
  <p>In my opinion Richard is one of the best mediators in the nursing home arena.
    &nbsp; He is fair to both the plaintiff and defense.&nbsp; Thus, defense counsel
    is quite often very willing to utilize his services, especially in light of his
    background.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, I highly recommend Richard's services as a mediator as I have
    found him to be very effective and have been very successful in mediating cases
    before him.</p>

  <p>As a Plaintiff's lawyer I recently had my first exposure to a mediation
    conducted with the assistance of Richard Strauss.</p>
  <p>The defense lawyer opposing in my case recommended Richard as a person that
    could settle difficult cases and bring parties together.</p>
  <p>I had no hesitancy in agreeing to allow Richard to conduct this mediation
    after reviewing his website.</p>
  <p>I can truly say that the website did not prepare me for the mediation that
    was experienced in Atlanta with Richard.&nbsp; I have never made the comment
    to anyone that "He is the best mediator I have ever experienced in my 20 years
    of mediation."&nbsp;This was the one mediation that I could truly make that
    statement.</p>
  <p>Richard's level of preparation and knowledge of the subject matter prior to
    the time of the mediation was exceptional.&nbsp; He put my clients at a comfort
    level and his opening comments helped them understand what they were about to
    participate in.</p>
  <p>Through his approach with my clients helping them understand areas of concern
    and his bringing to the table various options and suggestions throughout the
    negotiation we were able to settle a difficult case.</p>
  <p>I can highly recommend Richard as an excellent mediator and will certainly
    use him again in the future.</p>
  <p>In my opinion no member of the Plaintiff's bar should ever avoid Richard with
    his credentials of having a defense oriented background on paper as his past
    experience did nothing other than aid in the settlement of a difficult case.</p>
