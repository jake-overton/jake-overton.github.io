  <p>This letter is written to endorse Richard Strauss as a Mediator with whom I have had
    experience. As a plaintiff's lawyer mostly handing elder abuse cases, I have appreciated the
    services of Mr. Strauss.&nbsp; He is experienced in mediating these types of cases for me and
    local defense counsel.</p>
  <p>Mr. Strauss works hard to analyze the case materials before the mediation so that he
    is able to provide advice to both sides concerning the merits of their cases.&nbsp; This comes
    from a lot of experience not only as a Mediator but in the field of long term care claims
    adjusting.</p>
  <p>I heartily endorse him and welcome any inquiries.</p>

  <p>I wanted to share with you what a fine job I think you have done for my clients during a
    recent mediation of a long-term care case.&nbsp; This was my second mediation with you and I am
    even more impressed now than I was the first time.&nbsp; And that is saying something.</p>
  <p>I initially approached you as a mediator with some degree of skepticism since you were, in
    fact, recommended by defense counsel to serve as mediator in my first case with you.&nbsp; And,
    in this particular case, it was a second mediation.&nbsp; The first one failed after about one
    hour and
    no offers were even exchanged.&nbsp; This was a polarized case and you deftly and ably managed
    both our clients' expectations and also kept the
    dialogue moving.&nbsp; This was no easy task.
  </p>

  <p>I was deeply impressed with your level of preparation.&nbsp; You obviously are intimately
    familiar with the nuances of cases like this and absolutely "nailed" our case, including
    focusing on some strengths that I had not given proper consideration after spending a year with
    the case and personally preparing all of our experts for trial.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that you
    had very good instincts and were able to communicate to our clients (causing them to feel heard
    and understood) the strengths of our case.&nbsp; I have no doubt that this helped you in "the
    other room" with defense counsel.&nbsp; Similarly, you aptly summarized and articulated the
    defense position, but-importantly-did so in a way that was not polarizing to our clients.
    &nbsp; You have a gift for communicating the difficult with grace and in a way that is
    non-adversarial.&nbsp; Most importantly, you twisted arms when need be, but didn't have
    anybody feel like their arms were being twisted.</p>

  <p>You also helped to keep the process moving when it looked like settlement discussions were
    doomed toward inevitable failure.&nbsp; You had a lot of creative ideas and I appreciate you
    reaching, time and time again, into your bag of tricks to keep the parties talking.&nbsp; This
    brought conclusion to this difficult matter.</p>

  <p>I would have no hesitation using you on future matters, and, in fact, have recommended you to
    some of our partners.&nbsp; I wish you continued success in your career and look forward to
    working with you on the next case.</p>

  <p>Based on multiple positive experiences with Richard Strauss, I am able to unequivocally
    recommend him as a mediator.</p>
  <p>I was skeptical of Mr. Strauss as a mediator because of his background on the defense side
    of the practice and, in particular, his work in the nursing home industry. After several
    mediations, however, including some mediations that were among the most difficult I have ever
    encountered,&nbsp;I can say that Mr. Strauss' background is a significant benefit rather than a
    detriment.</p>
  <p>Richard brings to the table knowledge regarding how the other half of the practice thinks,
    and the benefit of thousands of mediations so that he has an understanding as to what cases
    are worth. &nbsp;He has never been less than completely prepared and has been able to articulate
    to both sides in mediation the important facts and theories without having to hear argument
    regarding those issues.</p>
  <p>When mediations have been particularly contentious or complicated, or when nothing else seems
    to work, Richard has been creative in his thought process and has made good suggestions to
    move the parties toward settlement.</p>
  <p>When mediations have been unsuccessful, Richard made constructive comments and suggestions
    that have helped move parties towards an ultimate resolution regardless of whether it occurs
    on the first day of mediation.&nbsp; I know from experience that he has mediated enough cases in
    Arizona to be familiar with the peculiarities of Arizona juries and has a very good sense
    of values in Arizona cases.</p>
  <p>For clients who are cost conscious,&nbsp;I can also tell you that Richard's services have
    been, at a minimum, competitive, and more frequently, economical given how difficult some of
    my cases have been to settle.&nbsp; To give one example,&nbsp;Richard mediated a nursing home
    for me about a year ago which went nowhere despite his best efforts.&nbsp; At the request of
    both parties shortly before a contractual arbitration, Richard mediated by telephone,
    without additional charge--a negotiation which took 14 moves on each side to get the case
    settled.&nbsp; While the number of moves was extremely frustrating for me personally,
    Richard never complained about the process and ultimately got the case concluded, with no
    additional fee.</p>
  <p>If anyone reading this has any questions about Richard Strauss, I would be pleased to speak
    with you personally.</p>

  <p>I have been utilizing the services of mediators for over fifteen years in my practice.&nbsp;
    Over the last couple of years, I retained Richard as a mediator for Assisted Living and
    Skilled Nursing cases where I represent the Plaintiff.&nbsp; I have found Richard to be
    thoroughly prepared in knowing the case inside and out when he comes to the table to mediate.
    &nbsp; Richard has a down to earth demeanor and approach that is always well received by
    the parties, even under the circumstances.&nbsp; My clients and I have been impressed with
    Richard and his mediation skills.&nbsp; I always consider Richard as my first choice when
    it comes to selecting a mediator.&nbsp; I would highly recommend Richard for your next
    mediation.</p>
