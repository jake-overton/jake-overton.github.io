  <hr class="main-hr">
  <p>As a plaintiff's lawyer, I recently had the
    opportunity to participate in a mediation in which Richard Strauss served as
    the Mediator.&nbsp; It was very clear from the onset of the mediation that Mr.
    Strauss was very objective and certainly not favoring one side or the other.&nbsp;
    I also found Richard to be a very effective Mediator with a very good grasp
    of medical knowledge.</p>
  <p>I strongly believe that Richard Strauss played
    a very important role in helping my client resolve their claim.&nbsp; It was
    very clear that Richard spent a great deal of time prior to the mediation learning
    the issues and preparing his own personal outline of the high-points and low-points
    of each parties case.&nbsp; There was no question that Richard had a great deal
    of experience in the medical field and I believe he helped point out very important
    issues to both sides.</p>
  <p>I will certainly use Richard in future mediations
    involving medical negligence, nursing home negligence, and personal injury claims.&nbsp;
    In addition to his preparation and knowledge, his fees were extremely reasonable
    considering that he had to fly to Fayetteville, Arkansas to attend the mediation.</p>
  <p>Once again, it was a pleasure working with Richard
    and if you would like to discuss anything with me, please do not hesitate to
    contact me.</p>

  <p>I write this letter in strong support of Richard M. Strauss serving as mediator for any type of nursing home negligence case.&nbsp; My co-counsel and I recently settled a high-value nursing home case shortly after a day of mediation which
    started with the parties being in completely different worlds in terms of case valuation.</p>
  <p>I will confess that I am not the biggest fan of mediation of nursing home cases, but this is due mostly to what I view as a lack of preparation, effort, and legitimate understanding of the issues by too many mediators. &nbsp; This is not an
    indictment of the process or all mediators.&nbsp; It is simply my opinion based on experience.</p>
  <p>In our case mediation was Court-ordered.&nbsp; The Court left it to the parties to agree on a mediator.&nbsp; The third-party claims adjuster recommended Mr. Strauss to serve as our mediator.&nbsp; In researching Mr. Strauss' background, it
    became apparent that he has a substantial mount of experience in representing defendants, and nursing home corporations in particular.&nbsp; While a background of that sort can be troubling to many plaintiffs' attorneys, including me, upon
    further investigation it was clear that Mr. Strauss has a broad base of support from both sides of the bar.</p>
  <p>After considering the comments of well-respected plaintiff's attorneys, my co-counsel and I agreed to the claim adjuster's recommendation of Mr. Strauss serving as our mediator.&nbsp; As usual, we spent a significant amount of energy in
    preparing a confidential mediation brief which we submitted to Mr. Strauss with the hope that he would actually read it and understand the issues.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss recommended that we not prepare any opening remarks or presentations, which is
    a bit unconventional.&nbsp; I now see why and agree so long as Mr. Strauss is the mediator.</p>
  <p>The mediation began with Mr. Strauss presenting my clients with a fairly lengthy presentation which appeared to be designed to take the parties and attorneys outside the litigation process and into a more appeasing setting.&nbsp; This was
    quite important to reaching a successful resolution.&nbsp; My clients had very strong feelings that their mother was neglected, and rightfully so.&nbsp; The manner in which Mr. Strauss put the clients at ease, connected with them, and
    understood their story built a level of trust that was critical to setting the stage for an environment that could be, and eventually was, successful.</p>
  <p>Following the opening remarks, the parties were separated to caucus.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss started in our room and went through a detailed explanation of the pros and cons of our case.&nbsp; I was extremely impressed with the level of preparation
    and understanding of the unique issued presented by most nursing home cases.&nbsp; In my experience, too many mediators have only a superficial understanding of pressure sores, malnutrition, dehydration, the causes for these injuries, staffing,
    state surveys, and the themes plaintiff's attorneys use to establish a corporate negligence case.&nbsp; Given Mr. Strauss' detailed discussion of the pros and cons of our case, it was very apparent to me, co-counsel, and our clients that Mr.
    Strauss has an excellent understanding of these issues and our case in particular due to his background and preparation for the mediation.</p>
  <p>As the day passed, it was clear that Mr. Strauss put forth maximum effort to attempt to bring the parties together to a mutually beneficial resolution.&nbsp; While movement was slow in the beginning, as it typically is, Mr. Strauss continued
    to work hard for us and propose beneficial options and suggestions throughout the day.&nbsp; In my view this was instrumental in achieving a successful result.</p>
  <p>At the end of the mediation, the parties had closed the gap by a large margin, but they remained a significant amount of money apart.&nbsp; I believe this was due to the high-value of the case and the fact that the parties started the
    mediation with an enormous gap in terms of case valuation.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss offered to remain involved in the negotiations at no additional charge, which is unprecedented in my experience.&nbsp; The case settled shortly after the mediation.
  </p>
  <p>I highly recommend Mr. Strauss to serve as mediator for any nursing home negligence case.&nbsp; With Mr. Strauss serving as our mediator, we received a level of preparation, persistence, creativity, and understanding of the issues unmatched by
    any mediator with whom I have ever worked.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss will be at the top of my list in selecting a mediator in future cases.</p>

  <p>I enjoyed the mediation session
    which Richard Strauss conducted last month regarding a nursing home case. &nbsp;What
    was noteworthy was Richard's ability as a mediator aside from his comprehension
    of the issues, is that he has a very pleasant demeanor, coupled with an organized
    mind. &nbsp;This would assist him in a potentially contentious process, although
    ours was not.</p>
