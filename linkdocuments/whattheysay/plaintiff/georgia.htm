  <p>I am writing to express my appreciation for your successful efforts in bringing the
    above-referenced case to a favorable resolution.</p>
  <p>Through your persistence, you took a case where settlement, at one point, appeared hopeless and
    used your skill, experience and understanding of long term care to obtain a settlement that our
    clients deemed very favorable in this case.&nbsp; I sincerely appreciate your efforts and will
    not hesitate to use you again as a mediator.&nbsp; I would readily recommend your services to
    any of my colleagues looking for a mediator in a nursing home case.</p>

  <p>We had the opportunity to have Richard serve as a mediator in a wrongful death case with
    multiple party defendants.&nbsp; We would recommend him for services as a neutral mediator in
    the future without hesitation... He worked with both sides, building not only our confidence in
    his ability to further meaningful negotiations, but our client's confidence as well...His
    experience in the insurance industry not only allowed him to place a value on the case that was
    objectively reasonable, but also to discuss this valuation with both defense counsel and their
    respective insurance company representatives (whom, in our case, included a district claims
    manager and two claims supervisors).</p>

  <p>I write this letter to strongly recommend and encourage the utilization of the services of
    Richard M. Strauss a mediator.&nbsp; Recently, I had the distinct pleasure of working with
    Richard as a mediator.&nbsp; Initially, I was very reluctant to use Richard based on his
    defense-oriented background and the fact that Defense Counsel had selected him.&nbsp; On the day
    of mediation I was pleasantly surprised and both my client and I were impressed with Richard's
    knowledge, skill and abilities.&nbsp; Perhaps more importantly, I was very impressed that
    Richard was a very fair mediator. From the recent mediation, it was obvious that Richard had
    read the file, and was familiar with all the issues in the case.&nbsp;
    Richard had also reviewed a case that was problematic for the Plaintiff's side of the case and
    was prepared to discuss its impact on my client's case.</p>
  <p>Nonetheless, Richard was able to bring both sides together to reach an amicable
    resolution.&nbsp; He explained his methods, the process, and was able to get my client to see,
    as he put it, &quot;Your demand is not real money&quot; but that the &quot;money offered by the
    Defendant could be deposited in any bank.&quot;</p>
  <p>The next time Richard is suggested as a mediator I will agree to utilize his services without
    hesitation.</p>

  <p>I have a plaintiff's practice and have been in many mediations.&nbsp; I recently represented a
    lady in a case made particularly difficult by the fact that my client was highly emotional about
    each and every issue.&nbsp; She could not handle any type of scrutiny.&nbsp; A simple question
    would have her at boiling point.&nbsp; She did badly at deposition and I did not think she would
    hold up on cross-examination if the case ever went to trial.I agreed to mediation and, two weeks
    ago, this was scheduled with Richard M. Strauss as mediator.Defense counsel suggested the
    mediator.&nbsp; I was a little uncomfortable with this.&nbsp; I prepared to offer a few names of
    my own and kick the issue around.&nbsp; Then I saw an article Mr. Strauss wrote in the Georgia
    Trial Lawyers' magazine and decided to try him.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I was concerned that this
    mediator had a defense-oriented background on paper.During the mediation I was pleasantly
    surprised to find that Mr. Strauss immediately zoned in on the strengths and weaknesses of both
    sides of the case.&nbsp; Most importantly, he recognized my client's volatility and sensitively
    worked around it to keep her at the table negotiating when I despaired that she would abort the
    process very early in the day.&nbsp; He was able to get her to see hard facts which went against
    her, negatives of the case I had discussed with her for more than a year without her recognizing
    them.I presume he was as competent at this with a tight-fisted insurance company adjuster for as
    the day went on we narrowed the gap.&nbsp; We were able to resolve the case for a figure I had
    in mind going in, one that made my client happy.I will use Mr. Strauss again and can recommend
    him.</p>

  <p>All of the cases I have mediated with Mr. Strauss have settled, and I and each of my clients
    were satisfied with the overall process and Mr. Strauss' ability to analyze the issues involved
    in each case and identify the potential risks to both sides.</p>
  <p class="author">Michael A. Cole<br>Atlanta</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Although Richard's background is defense oriented, I would recommend him to any plaintiff's
    trial lawyer, or defense lawyer since in all respects he was a professional, neutral
    mediator.&nbsp; He is courteous, patient, and realistic.&nbsp; I look forward to working with
    Richard on other big cases in the future.</p>

  <p>I am writing this letter to highly recommend Richard Strauss as a mediator to help you with
    whatever matter you are considering for his services.&nbsp; My experience with Richard in March,
    2005 left me with a very strong opinion that he was capable, objective and very effective in
    helping us to reach a resolution.</p>
  <p>Our case involved mortgage fraud and as the Plaintiff's attorney in that matter, I represented
    a large corporation.&nbsp; I have significant experience representing plaintiffs and defendants
    in business and real estate litigation.&nbsp; I would use Richard again regardless of whether I
    represent the plaintiff or defendant.</p>
  <p>There were nearly a dozen defendants in my case, each with a different objective and different
    set of circumstances.&nbsp; There were professionals with insurance.&nbsp; There was an
    insurance company that was a party.&nbsp; There were individuals with little or no money and
    several parties that had their various careers on the line.&nbsp; Richard was able to take these
    various factions and create a resolution acceptable to my client.</p>
  <p>Richard was well prepared and very determined.&nbsp; He had a thorough understanding of the
    issues in the case.&nbsp; More importantly however, he was able to quickly understand the
    specific objectives and motivations of the numerous parties, including the Plaintiff.&nbsp; His
    considerable defense experience made Richard an excellent evaluator of the various defendants'
    true strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; He was very capable of and very willing to filter out the
    rhetoric when helping me and my client to understand the defendants' real position and
    reasons.&nbsp; Richard's candor and honesty created an atmosphere where a thorough discussion
    and analysis of the case drove the negotiations more so than any other factor.</p>
  <p>Most importantly, Richard was successful because he was determined and never really seemed to
    slow down during a very long day.&nbsp; He managed to squeeze more from every single party long
    after they had all resolved to stop.&nbsp; It is very unlikely our case would have been settled
    with a less determined mediator.</p>
  <p>I highly recommend Richard Strauss as a mediator and will use him again.</p>

  <p>I just wanted to let you know that thanks to your relentless efforts, we were finally able to
    resolve the...case.&nbsp; My clients and I are appreciative and glad that all of your work was
    not for naught.</p>
  <p>So far you are batting a thousand on resolving my cases and we will certainly see if you can
    continue your magic.</p>

  <p>On December 9, 2003, we mediated a personal injury case with Richard Strauss acting as our
    mediator.&nbsp; The case involved both liability and underinsured motorist carrier's counsel,
    and therefore presented several challenging issues.</p>
  <p>During and after the mediation, I found that Mr. Strauss was able to (1) objectively analyze
    the issues, and (2) identify the risks to both parties in terms of liability and the limits of
    available insurance coverage.&nbsp; While the case did not resolve on the day of the mediation,
    Mr. Strauss offered and provided his services after the mediation, free of charge, which I
    believe helped in the ultimate resolution of the case several weeks later.&nbsp; I am willing
    and in fact have already scheduled him to serve as a mediator in another case next month, and am
    hopeful he will be as hard-working and effective as he was in this case.</p>
  <p class="author">Jeffrey B. Grimm<br>Atlanta</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Some plaintiff's attorneys may be hesitant about Richard's defense oriented resume.&nbsp;
    However, I found his past experience to be extremely valuable because he was able to communicate
    effectively with the defense attorneys, doctor defendant, hospital risk manager and most
    importantly, the defense insurers.&nbsp; Richard's objective analysis of the issues, his insight
    into the risk for both parties and his knowledge of the issues in the industry were very helpful
    in leading to a favorable resolution of this highly contested matter.&nbsp; I certainly
    recommend him for mediations in general, including medical malpractice cases.</p>

  <p>Regarding Richard M. Strauss, Esq., mediator, it has been my pleasure to work as a practicing
    attorney with Richard M. Strauss, as a mediator.&nbsp; The purpose of this letter is to highly
    recommend Mr. Strauss to those persons who may be seeking a good/objective mediator who has a
    thorough knowledge of the legal and practical issues involved in personal injury litigation, and
    especially medical malpractice and wrongful death litigation claims.</p>
  <p>In my experience with Richard as a mediator, I found him to be honest, intelligent and candid
    with regard to the analysis of the risk to both parties, and he was of great assistance in
    objectively assisting the resolution of the claims.</p>
  <p>Based upon my experience with Richard, we were able to resolve my claims in a satisfactory
    manner, and I look forward to utilizing his services again in many future mediations.&nbsp; I
    would highly recommend him as a mediator to all attorneys practicing in the personal injury
    field, whether they be primarily on the plaintiff's side or the defendant's side.</p>

    future every time we require the assistance of a mediator.&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>

  <p>I highly recommend Richard Strauss, Esquire, to mediate cases involving medical malpractice
    and/or nursing home litigation/long term care.&nbsp; Richard is very experienced, and I find
    that he is very objective in his approach towards mediating these complex cases.&nbsp; As a
    plaintiff's attorney, my clients are delighted to have someone fair and objective evaluate their
    cases to determine the best course during mediation.&nbsp; I have always found Mr. Strauss to be
    that type of mediator, and highly recommend him.</p>
  <p>If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.</p>

  <p>He was able to objectively analyze the issues, identify the risks to both parties and was

  <p>...we recently had a very good experience with Richard Strauss in a mediation of a tough
    nursing home case and that we were very pleased with his performance.&nbsp; Richard's vast

    in the future.</p>

  <p>I am writing to write a letter of recommendation for Richard Strauss.&nbsp; I had the pleasure
    of mediating a case recently with Richard.&nbsp; The case involved an injury as the result of an
    automobile accident.&nbsp; Richard seemed to have a firm grasp of all matters surrounding
    automobile accident litigation.&nbsp; At our mediation, he obviously read our memorandum about
    the case and was quick to zero in on the issues in the case and how to resolve them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the beginning of the mediation, he suggested a non-confrontational approach to the opening
    statements which set the stage for a meaningful mediation.&nbsp; Richard at all times was fully
    engaged in the mediation and resolving the matter in an expeditious manner.</p>
  <p>He appeared to value everyone's time.&nbsp; He appeared to understand the Plaintiff's concerns
    and was willing to offer options and suggestions throughout the entire process.&nbsp; He also
    seemed to put my client at ease which helped to insure my client was treated fairly throughout
    the mediation.</p>
  <p>We were able to successfully conclude a difficult case through the good efforts of Richard's
    mediation.&nbsp; I would recommend Richard to other Plaintiff's attorneys as someone who is easy
    to work with both in scheduling a mediation, preparing for the mediation and implementing a
    successful mediation process.</p>
  <p class="author">J. Lansing Kimmey<br>Atlanta</p>
  <hr />

  <p>At the inception of the mediation, we were not optimistic the case would ultimately be
    resolved.&nbsp; However, with Richard's objective analysis of the facts and his unique
    background with respect to acute care and nursing home pressure sore cases, he was able to
    convince my client, who was quite sophisticated, as well as the representatives of the
    Defendant, of the benefit and wisdom of compromising the case for the benefit of all
    parties.&nbsp; Throughout the mediation Richard continued to review and analyze the voluminous
    medical records with an aim toward identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the plaintiff and
    defendant positions in the case which aided his effort to persuade the decision makers of the
    benefit of a present resolution of the case.</p>

  <p>My firm handles a significant number of nursing home cases, as well as medical malpractice and
    other types of tort cases.&nbsp; I have had the pleasure of utilizing the services of Richard
    Strauss in several cases and have found him to be extremely hard working and dedicated in the
    mediation process and, unlike most mediators, does everything possible in order to try to bring
    the parties together to an amicable resolution.&nbsp; As a plaintiff's lawyer, I find two
    attributes that Richard has to be essential with regard to nursing home and medical cases.&nbsp;
    First, he is very compassionate and explains things extremely well to my clients.&nbsp; Second,
    his background in the nursing home industry, specifically in the area of risk management, causes
    him to be very knowledgeable in this specialized area and have tremendous credibility with
    nursing homes and their insurers.</p>
  <p>I would most certainly recommend Richard to anyone who handles nursing home and medical cases,
    but given his skills, abilities, and that fact that he is such a &quot;quick study,&quot; I am
    sure he would be a tremendously effective mediator in any type of case.&nbsp; I plan on using
    Richard's services as much as possible in the future.</p>

  <p>Mr. Strauss'&nbsp; opening comments put my clients at ease, and was of great assistance in
    managing their emotions and concerns through the course of a lengthy negotiation session.</p>
  <p>I would be willing to recommend Mr. Strauss as a mediator, without reservation.&nbsp; His
    skills and approach resulted in a fair and favorable resolution of the matter we mediated with
    him.</p>

  <p>Please let this letter serve as my recommendation of Richard Strauss as a mediator.&nbsp;
    Richard recently completed a mediation for me in a case involving negligence claims against both
    a nursing home and outside doctors.&nbsp; Our case against the nursing home settled largely due
    to the efforts of Richard.</p>
  <p>Among the many qualities I observed of Richard during the course of the mediation, the
    following stood out: his expertise in the subject matter, particularly nursing home matters; he
    came to the mediation prepared and it was evident from his opening statement that he knew the
    key issues in the case; he gave all parties involved the feeling from the opening statement on
    that he was there to help get the matter resolved in a conciliatory fashion and not in a
    forceful way; he approached both sides fairly and was able to engage in a discussion and
    analysis of the issues with not only the lawyers but also the clients; he knew when to keep the
    pace slow and he knew when to speed things up throughout the entire settlement negotiation phase
    of the mediation; and lastly, he was able to keep the clients comfortable with the proceedings,
    with opposing counsel and with him as the mediator.</p>
  <p>I would not hesitate to use Richard again, and would commend his services to both plaintiff and
    defense counsel and to insurers.</p>
  <p>I am happy to speak with anyone individually if you have any further questions about Richard's
    abilities.</p>
  <p class="author">Glenn Loewenthal<br>Atlanta</p>
  <hr />

  <p>We were aware of Richard's defense oriented background but had heard good things about
    him.&nbsp; Our expectations were exceeded.&nbsp; Richard quickly formed a good grasp of the
    peculiar issues in the case and helped us to negotiate a favorable settlement.&nbsp; We would
    not hesitate to use him on our more typical medical malpractice cases, nursing home cases, and
    other catastrophic cases.&nbsp; It is worth noting that we were not able to resolve the case on
    the day of mediation and that Richard remained very accessible and eager to participate in the
    case until it was resolved.&nbsp; We sincerely appreciate Richard's dedication to the goal of
    resolving complex catastrophic cases.</p>

  <p>I have used Richard Strauss as a mediator for multi-million dollar medical malpractice and
    nursing home cases.&nbsp; He is a very hardworking, dedicated mediator, who also exhibits
    compassion towards those who have suffered a great personal loss.&nbsp; As a plaintiff's
    counsel, I found his background in risk management and hospital administration to be an
    asset.&nbsp; He is quite knowledgeable in the medical arena and comprehends and assesses
    technical subjects very quickly... When you have a strong case, he is an excellent facilitator
    to bring parties together on a value upon which both sides can agree.</p>

  <p>Not only were my clients emotional about the case, but they were somewhat suspicious of the
    mediation process and preferred litigation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Mr. Strauss was patient and was
    not only able to win their trust in him, but also in the mediation process.&nbsp; The result of
    Mr. Strauss' skillful approach to the process was that he was able to break through a potential
    stalemate at the end of the day and get the parties to agree to a very satisfactory
    settlement.&nbsp; My clients left... extremely pleased, not only with the process and Mr.
    Strauss, but also with me.</p>

    to get the defense attorneys to understand the downside of their case was very helpful.&nbsp;

  <p>I personally recommend Richard M. Strauss of Duluth, Georgia, as a mediator in significant
    personal injury cases.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss recently served as a mediator in a very difficult case
    involving the deaths of a mother and two children in a situation where liability was still a
    major issue.</p>
  <p>Co-counsel and I frankly did not believe that the case could be resolved short of trial.&nbsp;
    However, the case did settle and the credit for that settlement is to some extent attributable
    to Mr. Strauss.</p>
  <p>I found Mr. Strauss to have significant expertise in the areas involved in the case.&nbsp; He
    also appeared to be extremely well prepared for each issue as it arose.&nbsp; His mannerisms and
    approach to the process were of great benefit in having the negligent parties reevaluate their
    positions while, at the same time, granting some level of comfort to our client and his trust in
    the process.&nbsp; I wholeheartedly endorse Mr. Strauss as a mediator in serious personal injury
    actions.</p>
  <p class="author">W. Wright Gammon, Jr.<br>Cedartown</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Mr. Strauss' unique experience in dealing with complex medicolegal matters allowed him to
    objectively analyze the issues and to identify the risks for both parties.&nbsp; His persistence
    encouraged the parties to recognize both the strengths and weaknesses of their respective
    claims... Mr. Strauss' tireless efforts in this instance produced a multi-million dollar
    settlement that satisfied all parties.&nbsp; We, therefore, can whole-heartedly recommend Mr.
    Strauss' services to any litigants who truly desire to resolve major personal injury cases
    honorably.</p>

  <p class="author">Stephen Apolinsky<br>Decatur</p>

  <p>...I was not disappointed by Richard's service as a mediator in this case.&nbsp; He was very
    patient and determined in his efforts to attempt to bring the parties to an acceptable
    compromise... and he exhibited at all times a totally professional approach to a difficult
    resolution of the dispute which was mediated... I would recommend that any plaintiff's trial
    lawyer, or defense lawyer for that matter, seriously consider utilizing Richard Strauss as a
    neutral mediator in difficult and complex cases involving substantial claims.</p>
  <p class="author">W. Fred Orr, II<br>Decatur</p>
  <hr />

  <p>With an extensive background on the defendant's side of the table, as plaintiffs' attorneys we
    were a little leery.&nbsp; However, as the mediation progressed, Mr. Strauss's experience on the
    defense side enables him to understand the issues in a fraction of the time it would have taken
    a less experienced, less knowledgeable individual.&nbsp; This allowed the parties to focus on
    the real issues and ultimately to get the case settled.</p>
  <p class="author">William G. Quinn, III<br>Decatur</p>

  <p>Please accept this letter as our recommendation for Mediator Richard M. Strauss.&nbsp; We
    recently used Mr. Strauss to mediate a very complex and difficult medical malpractice claim
    involving infection.&nbsp; The case had dragged on for more than three years before the parties
    were able to consider mediation.</p>
  <p>We found Mr. Strauss to be very well educated on the subject matter of our case.&nbsp; Before
    the mediation, we sent Mr. Strauss a plaintiff's mediation summary.&nbsp; This summary was very
    detailed and included parts of testimony and evidence that we believed were critical to our
    case.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss took the time to review this information before the mediation.&nbsp; The
    information was also instrumental in explaining to the opposing council why it would be
    beneficial for our client to allow mediation at our offices.</p>
  <p>Mr. Strauss' opening comments of the mediation were very helpful in explaining to the client
    the purpose of mediation and also helped facilitate an environment at the mediation where a
    compromise and resolution of the issues of the case could take place.&nbsp; Our client, who had
    suffered horrible deformities as a result of the medical negligence felt comfortable with Mr.
    Strauss and appreciated his sensitive demeanor towards her case.&nbsp; We found Mr. Strauss'
    background as in-house defense counsel to be beneficial to us in finding a resolution for this
    case.&nbsp; We also found Mr. Strauss to be very impartial regarding the parties positions and
    he worked very hard to draw the money out from the defense as well as explain candidly to our
    client the weaknesses in our case.</p>
  <p>It is quite refreshing to have a mediator who is willing to go the extra mile prior to the
    mediation and who is also willing to work so hard to try and reach a settlement while the
    parties are in private caucus.</p>

  <p>...it became readily apparent early on in the mediation that Mr. Strauss was one of the most
    competent and skillful negotiator/mediators I have ever been involved with... Please be advised
    that in the future, any mediation that I have...involving these types of issues, I would
    request, and in fact, would demand Richard M. Strauss.</p>

  <p>Recently, I had the occasion to engage the services of Richard M. Strauss as a mediator in a
    medical malpractice case.&nbsp; During the course of the process, I found Richard to be well
    prepared, thorough, and quite familiar with the issues. The mediation was successful and this
    success was in large part due to the manner in which Richard conducted the process.&nbsp; I
    would not hesitate to use Richard again in future mediations/arbitrations and without
    hesitation, I recommend him to others.</p>

  <p>Mr. Strauss contacted me, prior to the mediation, and obtained copies of our case file and the
    opposing attorney's case file.&nbsp; When he arrived, he had a working knowledge of the facts
    and issues before mediation began.&nbsp; By being so well prepared, he was able to slice through
    the liability question quickly and get to the damages issues without wasting time.&nbsp; This is
    the first mediation to which I have been a party where the mediator was so well prepared!
    Because of his experience in nursing home negligence and medical malpractice cases, he was able
    to help with the settlement by introducing and proposing unique settlement options.</p>

  <p>I have been practicing exclusively as a plaintiff's attorney in Macon, Georgia for the past
    thirty-four years.&nbsp; In September, I used Richard Strauss as a mediator in a case against a
    Nursing Home involving neglect for the causation of bed sores.&nbsp; Prior to mediation, I
    provided Richard with the Settlement Demand with exhibits for review of the case.&nbsp; In
    addition, Richard wanted to meet with me and then with the clients to make sure he understood
    the legal issues and for the clients to obtain their perspective.&nbsp; I was pleasantly
    surprised about the thoroughness of his research for both sides.&nbsp; He explained the
    strengths and weaknesses of each party throughout the eight plus hours of mediation and was
    extremely professional and courteous to all sides.</p>
  <p>It was the direct result of his preparation and professionalism throughout the mediation that
    we were able to reach a very successful settlement of my client's claims.&nbsp; I would highly
    recommend Richard Strauss as a mediator.</p>

  <p>I have recently had my first experience using Richard Strauss as a mediator. &nbsp;The case was
    a personal injury matter stemming from a motor vehicular accident involving a passenger
    automobile and a semi-tractor trailer.&nbsp; I represented the plaintiff.</p>
  <p>The mediation was successfully concluded, due in large part to Mr. Strauss' familiarity with
    the facts of the case.&nbsp; I had sent a package of material on the case to Mr. Strauss prior
    to the mediation, and it was obvious that he had studied it and had mastered the facts of the
    case.</p>
  <p>His positive attitude throughout the entire day of the mediation was very encouraging to both
    sides and, I am sure, resulted in the case being successfully concluded.</p>
  <p>I recommend Mr. Strauss without hesitation and I will use him again if the opportunity presents
    itself.</p>
  <p>If any person reading this recommendation would like further comments from me regarding Mr.
    Strauss and his mediation abilities/techniques, please feel free to contact me by telephone.</p>

  <p>I was recently involved as Plaintiff's counsel representing an elderly woman who sustained a
    femur fracture while in a rehabilitation center.&nbsp; Counsel for the parties utilized Richard
    M. Strauss, Esq. as the mediator.&nbsp; Although Mr. Strauss was recommended by defense counsel
    to serve as the mediator, I found Mr. Strauss as early as the opening statement reflected a keen
    understanding of the issues to be resolved.&nbsp; Because of the vast experience and expertise
    of Mr. Strauss, the parties were able to resolve this case to the satisfaction of both the
    Plaintiff and the Defendant.&nbsp; I would recommend Mr. Strauss again in the future as a
    "motivating" mediator for both Plaintiffs as well as Defendants.</p>

  <p>I have known Richard M. Strauss for several years in his role as mediator in a number of
    nursing home cases.&nbsp; I have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Strauss during mediation
    in three states and would highly recommend him to both the Plaintiff's and Defense bar.</p>
  <p>Richard has always come to the mediations fully prepared, not only as a result of his history
    and experience, but also by virtue of having thoroughly reviewed and digested the materials
    concerning the cases in which he sits as a neutral.&nbsp; On the few occasions in which the
    mediation was not successfully concluded, Mr. Strauss has spent innumerable hours post-mediation
    at no additional cost to the parties in a continued effort to bring the parties to a successful
    resolution.&nbsp; I have found Richard to be extremely successful in the post-mediation process
    and has resolved the cases that were unsuccessful at the original mediation.</p>
  <p>I have also found that Richard's costs for services are extremely reasonable, particularly
    given his vast experience as a former Vice-President of Risk Management, Vice-President of
    Claims and Director of Claims, and his dealings with nursing home corporate entities and
    insurers.&nbsp; I have found Richard's unique qualifications and abilities to be a primary asset
    in the resolution of these difficult cases.&nbsp; Both Plaintiffs and Defendants would be well
    served to engage him as a neutral in any matter involving these difficult emotional issues.</p>

  <p>I am a retired chiropractor and practicing plaintiff's attorney who specializes in the areas of
    personal injury and medical negligence.&nbsp; I have known Richard Strauss over a period of the
    past four years.&nbsp; He was recommended to me by a fellow plaintiff's attorney with extensive
    nursing home litigation experience.&nbsp; Richard has recently mediated a medical negligence
    case for me with a favorable outcome. Richard works exclusively as a neutral and is well versed
    to handle these cases based on his background in the health field.&nbsp; While his background is
    defense oriented, he is able to be objective and effective in his handling of these cases.&nbsp;
    His professionalism, expertise, and pleasing demeanor serve him well in his ability to appeal to
    all parties.&nbsp; I would not hesitate to use Richard in future mediations and would recommend
    that you utilize his services.</p>

  <p>I am very happy to report to you that my dental malpractice case in which you served as
    mediator was successfully concluded recently.&nbsp; It is my firm opinion and belief that the
    sole reason that this case was successfully concluded was your extreme confidence and skills as
    a mediator and the respect that your presence generated on both sides of this case.</p>
  <p>It was a pleasure to experience your objectivity and impartiality in analyzing the issues of
    our case.&nbsp; You did an excellent job in pointing out to both parties the risks inherent with
    going forward in this case without a successful mediation, which I feel both sides grew to
    appreciate as the day went along.</p>
  <p>Not only will I be pleased to have you serve as a mediator in my future cases, but I will also
    strongly recommend your skills as a mediator to any attorney I speak with.</p>
  <p>I would like to take this opportunity to wish you and your family a Happy and Healthy New Year
    and I will look forward to working with you for many years
    to come.</p>

  <p>I recently was introduced to the mediation services offered by Richard Strauss.&nbsp; I
    represented a nursing home resident who had been raped by another resident within the
    facility.&nbsp; The defense attorney recommended Mr. Strauss.</p>
  <p>We were able to resolve the case with Mr. Strauss' assistance as mediator.&nbsp; He was likely
    the most prepared mediator I have ever worked with.&nbsp; His level of preparation made opening
    statements unnecessary, thus saving time.&nbsp; With his help, we were able to focus on key
    issues directly affecting liability, causation and damages.</p>
  <p>I believe that Mr. Strauss' corporate and defense background in the nursing home industry was
    actually an asset.&nbsp; He has a thorough working knowledge of OBRA Regulations and standard of
    care issues.&nbsp; His background, knowledge and expertise were applied evenly and his objective
    candor was appreciated by all involved.</p>
  <p>Nursing home malpractice litigation comprises a significant part of my docket.&nbsp; I would
    not hesitate to call upon Mr. Strauss again to serve as mediator.</p>

  <p>Mr. Strauss demonstrated a marked ability to focus the parties on the primary issue in dispute
    and assist the parties in moving this case toward settlement by identifying the risks a jury
    trial may present to the parties and the benefits of a final resolution via a mediated
    settlement.&nbsp; I am please to recommend Mr. Strauss as a fair and impartial mediator for
    serious personal injury cases...</p>

  <p>I have just had the opportunity and privilege to conclude a very difficult personal injury case
    through mediation with Richard M. Strauss at MediateOne, Inc., serving as the mediator.&nbsp;
    This case had extensive causation, compensatory and punitive damages issues, all of which played
    a role in the parties agreeing to a final settlement in this particular case.</p>
  <p>After almost thirty (30) years of practice and dealings with mediators from all the major
    mediation services along the eastern seaboard, and having experienced every type and style of
    mediator that one could imagine, this experience with Richard M. Strauss was without question
    one of the most refreshing, productive and reinvigorating mediation processes to which I have
    ever been a party.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss' grasp of the issues to be resolved, his clear
    understanding of the overall litigation process, particularly from his perspective as a
    corporate and "in-house" counsel, his impeccable preparation based on the submission of the
    parties' Pre-Mediation Briefs and most importantly, his patience and creative approaches to
    argumentative hurdles in the mediation process was truly outstanding.</p>
  <p>Almost as important to my own comfort level was my client's comfort level with what he was
    hearing from the mediator during conferences.&nbsp; My client felt that he was receiving fair
    and objective analysis of the issues that were important to him and that the final result of Mr.
    Strauss' sincere efforts was truly a just conclusion in the mediation process.</p>
  <p>Quite frankly, I would utilize Mr. Strauss in any variety of cases not just personal injury
    cases and will without question, make all possible efforts in the future to engage Mr. Strauss
    in mediations, regardless of the forum, venue or subject matter of the case involved.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the more difficult the case the greater the need to have a mediator of Mr.
    Strauss' acumen and personal characteristics to resolve that matter.</p>

  <p>This was a particularly difficult case for various reasons, and my clients' emotions were
    running high.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Richard remained very patient with my clients and gave them
    the opportunities they needed to vent their frustrations about the circumstances that led to the
    case.&nbsp; He was also creative in his approaches and determined in his efforts to bring the
    parties to a resolution...I would not hesitate to recommend him as a mediator in any cases and
    particularly, in complex cases involving substantial claims.</p>
