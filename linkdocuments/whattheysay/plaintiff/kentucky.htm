  <h1>Kentucky</h1>
  <hr class="main-hr">
  <p>I am an attorney in Florence, Kentucky who handles a variety of personal injury
    litigation.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of working with Richard Strauss, Esq. for the
    first time in a nursing home negligence case which I had pending in Kenton County,
    Kentucky.</p>
  <p>Prior to filing suit I had submitted a settlement demand to the defense attorney
    and insurance carrier for the nursing home, both of whom indicated that they were
    interested in attempting to resolve the case without the need for litigation.</p>
  <p>Shortly thereafter, I was contacted by Defense Counsel indicating that her client
    and client's insurance carrier were interested in trying to resolve the matter and
    asked if I was willing to mediate.&nbsp; Defense Counsel then asked if I would
    be willing to use Attorney Richard Strauss from Duluth, Georgia as the mediator.
    &nbsp; At this point in time, I had never used Mr. Strauss and had only heard of
    him from an Attorney in Louisville, Kentucky.&nbsp; The Defense Attorney indicated
    that she had never used Mr. Strauss but rather her carrier recommended him.&nbsp;
    Being somewhat skeptical of an out of town mediator I had never used, I conducted
    some research on Mr. Strauss.&nbsp; Specifically, I went to his web site and found
    a wealth of information verifying his knowledge and expertise in these types of
    claims.&nbsp; Even more helpful to me were testimonials from Plaintiff Attorneys
    from Kentucky, all of whom I know of and some of them I am very good friends with.</p>
  <p>I then contacted two of the attorneys who had provided a testimonial on the
    Kentucky list.&nbsp;
    Both highly recommended Mr. Strauss to mediate my case, and both indicated Mr.
    Strauss had been recommended by the defense carrier for their respective case.&nbsp;
    Based on these recommendations I was comfortable with Mr. Strauss and immediately
    contacted Defense Counsel agreeing to us him as our Mediator.</p>
  <p>Within two months of contacting Mr. Strauss, our mediation took place at my
    office in Florence, Kentucky.&nbsp; Obviously, Mr. Strauss drove to my office
    from Georgia to appear in person.&nbsp; It was readily apparent that Mr. Strauss
    was extremely prepared and reviewed the relevant materials each party had submitted
    to him in advance of the mediation.&nbsp; I also had an opportunity to have
    some private conversation with Mr. Strauss regarding issues surrounding the case
    and possible future issues that may arise.</p>
  <p>I felt that his approach to the opening session was excellent in that he spent
    the majority of the time explaining the mediation process, his purpose, his review
    and his goal at mediation, rather than each side giving opening statements which in
    my experience only polarizes the parties, making it more difficult for the mediator
    to accomplish&nbsp;his/her job.&nbsp; Throughout the several hours of mediation,
    Mr. Strauss was not just a "number deliverer", but rather got involved in some of
    the key issues in the case and provided an offered analysis with each move in
    negotiations.</p>
  <p>His level of knowledge and attention to the client's questions and/or needs
    helped move the negotiations along in a productive manner which ultimately
    resulted in a satisfactory settlement for all parties involved.&nbsp; Actually,
    Mr. Strauss raised a few issues that I was aware of but did not appreciate as
    much as he did, which affected the overall evaluation of the case.</p>
  <p>I not only strongly recommend the use of Richard Strauss to mediate your case,
    I intend to use him on several other cases in the office.&nbsp; Of all the
    mediations I have attended in my career, I have never come across a more
    prepared mediator.</p>
  <p>I hope you find this helpful in your decision to retain Richard Strauss as
    mediator in your case.&nbsp; Should you have any questions or wish to discuss
    further I can be reached at (859) 371-3600 or by email jayvaughn@bfzlaw.com</p>

  <p>I am an attorney in Louisville, Kentucky, with a practice devoted 100% to
    personal injury victims and civil litigation.&nbsp; I recently had the
    opportunity to mediate a hotly litigated, disputed liability nursing home
    abuse and neglect death case with Mediator Richard Strauss.</p>
  <p>To be frank, I was initially skeptical, as Mr. Strauss is not local and came
    at the recommendation of defense counsel; I was reassured when several colleagues
    vouched for his ability to create a conciliatory environment for compromise
    and resolution, his subject matter expertise, and, most importantly, results.
    &nbsp; At mediation, my client, co-counsel, and I were immediately impressed
    with Mr. Straussï¿½ level of preparation and understanding of the key issues
    in the case.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss was willing to offer options and suggestions
    throughout the entire settlement negotiation phase of the mediation and my
    client was immediately at ease.&nbsp; It became apparent that he also had
    the ear of defense counsel and the nursing home insurance representative.</p>
  <p>Mr. Strauss successfully mediated this tough case in a relatively conservative
    (Kentucky) jurisdiction.&nbsp; I feel extremely confident in recommending him
    to my fellow members of the Bar.&nbsp; If you have any questions, or wish to
    discuss further, please feel free to give me a call.</p>

  <p>I write this letter to encourage the selection of Richard Strauss as a mediator
    in any nursing home/negligence cases my fellow plaintiff practitioners may have.
    &nbsp; My name is Chris Meinhart, and I have practiced Plaintiff personal injury
    law for 23 years in Louisville, Kentucky and have had the distinct pleasure of
    teaching Trial Practice at the Brandeis School of Law at the University of Louisville
    for the past five years.&nbsp; I have tried over 100 cases of all different
    types.&nbsp; This letter is certainly not intended to be about me, but rather
    about Mr. Strauss, any by way of background, I thought it best the reader know
    who this letter of recommendation was coming from.</p>
  <p>In the last few years I have concentrated my practice in nursing home negligence.
    &nbsp; I have mediated many cases, some to successful settlement, some not.&nbsp;
    This past month I had the pleasure of mediating a case with Richard Strauss in
    Louisville, Kentucky.&nbsp; Richard came up from Georgia and conducted the mediation
    to what I believe was a very successful, albeit confidential, settlement.</p>
  <p>I have not met any lawyer, mediator, adjuster or other person in the field of
    nursing home negligence that has brought as much experience and knowledge to the
    table as does Richard. It was invaluable and proved instrumental in bringing the
    case to conclusion.&nbsp; I had an intelligent, yet high strung, daughter of a
    gentlemen who had been overdosed at a nursing home which led to his death.&nbsp;
    My team prepared a fairly significant factual and legal background and sent the
    same to Richard well in advance of mediation (per his request).&nbsp; I truly
    felt Richard may have known the case better than I by the time we set down at
    the mediation table.</p>
  <p>I have long been a believer that opening comments can sometimes be polarizing.
    &nbsp; However, if the other side wants to give an opening, I feel compelled to
    do the same.&nbsp; I find myself dancing this delicate dance trying to impress
    upon the adjuster/defendants the strength of the case while not offending the
    other side of the room to the extent that we spend the next couple of hours
    repairing the damage my opening statements may have done.&nbsp; Richard's theory
    on waiving openings and letting him comment on what is necessary to bring the
    case to a successful resolution proved instrumental in bringing my recent case
    to a successful settlement.</p>
  <p>Too often mediators I have used in the past seem to listen to openings, engage
    in some substantive issue exchange in the first couple of rounds, but then go
    onto nothing more than trading numbers.&nbsp; Richard was continually thinking
    outside
    the box and came up with creative suggestions to try and bring the parties to
    a middle ground for closure.</p>
  <p>My personal pet peeve with mediations is that it seems to be unfair to my client.
    &nbsp; Almost everyone else has always been through many mediations in their
    profesional career.&nbsp; However, the plaintff has not and there seems to be
    an unfair level of anticipation, nervousness, etc.&nbsp; Richard spent a good
    deal of time with my client but was very productive in doing so in calming her
    and alleviating her fears that he was going to work for us as hard or harder as
    he was for the defense.&nbsp; He established a comfort level with her that I
    have not seen in many other mediators.</p>
  <p>The proof is in the pudding.&nbsp; Since that mediation, I have already
    scheduled another case with Richard and am suggsting his services for a third
    upcoming mediation.</p>
  <p>Should anyone have any questions or concerns with regard to my comments and
    thoughts on Richard's services, please feel free to call me.</p>

  <p>As a Plaintiff's attorney I am always looking for a competent Mediator that
    will not be objectionable to the defense.&nbsp; Although Richard has more of a
    defense background, he is an excellent neutral.&nbsp; His qualifications and
    medical background as well as his "tableside manner" enhance his effectiveness.
    &nbsp; Perhaps more impressive is the extent which he prepares.&nbsp; What a
    refreshing (and unique) benefit.</p>
  <p>I was also pleased that my concerns about jurisdiction were squelched.&nbsp;
    My practice is in Kenucky...and, even though Richard is a Georgia Boy, he did
    a wonderful job for my client.</p>
  <p>I am pleased to take this opportunity to recommend Richard Strauss as a Mediator.
    &nbsp; You are welcome to contact me with questions.</p>

  <p> Recently, I used Richard Strauss as a mediator in a nursing home negligence
    case.&nbsp; Initially, I was extremely reluctant to consider using him, or
    even mediating the case at all.&nbsp; The case was fairly new, and not a
    significant amount of discovery had taken place.&nbsp; The defense was extremely
    optimistic about the likelihood of success at mediation, and I felt obliged to
    at least explore whether the case could actually be resolved.&nbsp; When they
    suggested Richard Strauss, I was a little surprised since he was in Atlanta
    and our case was venued in Paducah, Kentucky.&nbsp; Regardless, after speaking
    with other lawyers about Richard's success, I felt comfortable enough to at
    least try.</p>
  <p>I was immediately impressed with Richard's style when he and I had a private
    caucus prior to the mediation.&nbsp; It was clear he had read the majority of
    the voluminous medical records and summaries I had prepared and forwarded to
    him.&nbsp; He had a thorough understanding of not only the facts of the case,
    but also of the specific nursing home regulations involved in the care and
    treatment of my client.</p>
  <p>Richard's demeanor with my clients was extremely impressive and they were
    treated as integral parts of the mediation process and not simply as silent
    observers.</p>
  <p>Far too often, I am disappointed in mediators because they simply tend to
    carry numbers back and forth instead of trying to help both parties understand
    the relative strengths and weaknesses of their case.&nbsp; I believe Richard did
    that for both sides.</p>
  <p>At the end of the day, Richard was successfully able to resolve a claim which
    I thought had very little chance of resolving.&nbsp; He did so in such a way
    that my clients were convinced they had been treated fairly in the process and
    that their loved one's memory had been honored.</p>
  <p>I strongly recommend Richard as a mediator and I can say he is one of the
    best mediators with whom I have ever had the pleasure to work.&nbsp; I plan
    to work with him frequently again in the future.</p>

  <p>On August 18, 2008, I had the pleasure of utilizing Richard M. Strauss,
    Esq., as a mediator in a complex nursing home negligence case.&nbsp; Generally
    speaking, my experience with most mediators in these types of claims has been
    lukewarm at best. I am pleased to say that Richard was absolutely spectacular.</p>
  <p>Richard's vast background and experience in nursing home cases was more than
    helpful for all parties involved.&nbsp; However, Richard did not simply fall
    back upon his experience and expertise.&nbsp; He had so thoroughly reviewed
    and prepared for the mediation that it was abundantly clear that he was going
    to be in asset in both rooms toward resolution.&nbsp; Richard's approach to
    mediation&nbsp;dispenses with part of the process that typically results only
    in acrimony and creating a hostile environment thereby jeopardizing any real
    chance of settlement.&nbsp; His thorough discussion and analysis of the issues
    helped my client immensely.&nbsp; My client felt at ease at the outset and throughout
    the process as a result of Richard's demeanor and obvious knowledge.</p>
  <p>I can and do recommend Richard very highly to mediate any claim, but especially
    those involving complex issues in the medical and nursing field.&nbsp; I look
    forward to the opportunity to utilize his services again in my own practice
    and would welcome any private inquiries about Richard's ability to serve as
    a mediator.</p>

  <p>Defense counsel recommended we use Richard Strauss to mediate our nursing
    home neglect case.&nbsp; I was skeptical at first, but agreed to utilize
    Richard's services based on opposing counsel's glowing recommendation and
    Richard's inimitable qualifications.</p>
  <p>I was pleasantly surprised when Richard arrived at the mediation with a
    legal pad full of notes, complete command of the facts of the case, and an
    obvious grasp of the legal issues.&nbsp; Despite his defense oriented background,
    I found Richard to be fair, impartial, and most importantly, supremely focused
    on resolving the dispute.</p>
  <p>I have already enlisted Richard to mediate my next nursing home case, and
    have recommended him to a number of colleagues.</p>

  <p>I recently mediated a case using Mr. Richard Strauss as the mediator.&nbsp;
    When the counsel for the defendant recommended him, I was a bit concerned.&nbsp;
    After a thorough review of his &quot;information package,&quot; we decided to
    give him a try.&nbsp; This was a high dollar case with three plaintiffs against
    a defendant/trucking company.&nbsp; There was limited insurance coverage and
    several liability and defense theories.</p>
  <p>When I got to the mediation site early, Mr. Strauss was already there. I was
    pleasantly surprised that his preparation, knowledge of the facts and issues and
    subject matter expertise were superb.&nbsp; It was clear that he had studied every
    deposition and all of the medical reports from the three plaintiffs.&nbsp; He
    knew all of the theories of liability and anticipated the defenses to them.&nbsp;
    This allowed him to conduct a professional mediation without having to be overly
    briefed by the parties.&nbsp; This kept opening statements simple and
    straightforward and allowed us to get to the negotiations expeditiously.</p>
  <p>The mediation was a great success for all of the parties.&nbsp; I would highly
    recommend Mr. Strauss to plaintiffs and defendants alike.</p>

  <p>I have been strictly a Plaintiff lawyer for 48 years. My practice involves
    all types of personal injury and wrongful death cases, including motor vehicle,
    premises liability, medical malpractice and nursing home or long term care.</p>
  <p>Richard M. Strauss, Esq. recently served as a mediator in a difficult 3-party
    long term care case, which involved both a nursing home and a hospital as
    defendants. Mr. Strauss showed an exceptional knowledge and expertise in the
    subject matter of the mediation. His level of preparation and understanding of
    the key issues in the case went far beyond my expectations. I was particularly
    impressed by the opening comments of Mr. Strauss that were specifically directed
    towards creating the conciliatory environment necessary for compromise and
    resolution. His approach towards a thorough discussion and analysis of the
    issues in the case was outstanding. He exhibited willingness to offer options
    and suggestions throughout the entire settlement negotiation phase of the
    mediation process. Mr. Strauss created a comfort level which was conducive
    to settlement of the case. Although my practice is exclusively in Kentucky,
    I believe that Richard Strauss has the ability to effectively mediate
    regardless of jurisdiction or venue.</p>
  <p>In short, I wholeheartedly recommend Richard M. Strauss, Esq. as a mediator.</p>

  <p>Richard turned out to be one of the most prepared mediators I have ever
    encountered.&nbsp; He knew the facts of the case and the law cold.&nbsp;
    He was able to summarize and relay weaknesses of the case to my client in a
    manner which was simultaneously straight forward and compassionate.&nbsp; His
    recitation of the facts (both favorable and non-favorable) was so thorough and
    on point that I found myself scribbling notes on matters to address in voir dire
    and opening.</p>
  <p>Richard was able to lay a great foundation with his knowledge of the case and
    deameanor which ultimately lead to a signed settlement agreement by day's end.</p>
