  <h1>Louisiana</h1>
  <hr class="main-hr">
  <p>I recently had the pleasure of working with Richard wherein we successfully
    mediated the majority of a very difficult and complicated case.&nbsp;
    We were able to resolve many of the contested issues and greatly simplify
    the litigation as a whole...</p>
  <p>Richard's knowledge of the subject matter was to say the least, surprising
    and refreshing.&nbsp; Richard is now one of the two mediators I will agree to
    work with in the future.&nbsp; He was thorough, professional, diligent, at times
    dogmatic and most importantly neutral.</p>
  <p>From the inception of the mediation Richard was able to create an atmosphere
    which I felt promoted openness in discussion which obviously steered the matter
    toward resolution.&nbsp; I specifically would like to reiterate the level of
    preparation exhibited.&nbsp; Not only was he intimately familiar with all of the
    facts presented on both sides, but also the implicit arguments that would be made
    based on those facts.&nbsp; He further very astutely was able to help all involved
    to recognize and/or acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses in each.</p>
  <p>If I can be of any further assistance, or if any person to whom this concerns
    would like to speak with me, please feel free to contact me...</p>
