  <h1>Maryland</h1>
  <hr class="main-hr">
  
  <p>We recently represented plaintiff's surviving family in a wrongful dealt suit
    against an Assisted Living Facility.&nbsp; Early in the litigation process, defendant's
    counsel suggested mediation with Richard Strauss, Esquire.&nbsp; Although we were
    initially skeptical about mediating with a mediator chosen by the defense, we decided to
    give it a try after reviewing many positive recommendations from plaintiff's' attorneys.</p>
  <p> Mediation was recently held and did result in a settlement satisfactory to
    plaintiffs.&nbsp; I want to state that I found Mr. Strauss to be a true neutral
    party notwithstanding his defense background.&nbsp; He came to the mediation thoroughly
    prepared and had an excellent understanding of all the issues in the case.&nbsp; He made
    the plaintiffs feel comfortable throughout the mediation and I believe they did
    trust his judgment and his sincere interest in getting the case settled.</p>
  <p>I have been involved as an attorney representing the plaintiff in hundreds of
    mediations and have served as a court appointed mediator in the Circuit Court
    for Anne Arundel County, Maryland.&nbsp; I am a graduate of the Harvard Law School
    Program on Mediation.</p>
  <p>Based on my background and experience in the recent case with Mr. Strauss, I
    can state that he is an excellent mediator and that I would not hesitate to
    refer a case to him in the future.</p>
