	<p>I recently had the opportunity to participate in a successful mediation
		wherein Richard Strauss was the mediator.&nbsp; I thought he did a fine job.</p>
	<p>Mr. Strauss was recommended to me by the defense counsel in the case.&nbsp;
		I always find in a mediation that I want a mediator that the defendant will
		listen to.&nbsp; Therefore, I was receptive to the defense counsel's suggestion.</p>
	<p>He mentioned that he had over 2200 mediations under his belt.&nbsp; He was
		thoroughly prepared.&nbsp; His level of understanding in this medical malpractice
		case was thorough.&nbsp; He was not afraid to give positive and negative points
		to both sides regarding the case.&nbsp; His approach led to a thorough discussion
		of the issues in the case without polarizing the parties.</p>
	<p>Accordingly, I would recommend Mr. Strauss to a Plaintiff's lawyer with a
		medical malpractice case.&nbsp; I am sure I will use him again in the future.</p>

	<p>I am writing to commend you on the manner in which you recently mediated our
		plaintiff's case in Belleville, IL.</p>
	<p>I can tell you, without reservation, that all of the attorneys who were involved
		in this case were extremely pleased with the way you conducted the mediation,
		your effectiveness in garnering compromise from both sides, and, of course, a
		result that was acceptable to all parties concerned.</p>
	<p>I should let you know that a friend from law school who has done defense work
		in Kansas City, Missouri, for over 40 years recently called to ask for the names
		of mediators that I would recommend.&nbsp; I gave him your name and later called him
		to tell him about you.</p>
	<p>If a plaintiff's attorney is in need of a reference regarding your services,
		please do not hesitate to have them contact me.</p>
	<p>We look forward to mediating with you in the future.&nbsp; Your objectivity
		and impartiality are strong characteristics which we appreciate finding in a
		mediator.</p>
