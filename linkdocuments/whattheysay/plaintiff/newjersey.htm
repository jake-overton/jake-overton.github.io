  <h1>New Jersey</h1>
  <hr class="main-hr">


  <p>I am a plaintiff's personal injury attorney in New Jersey.&nbsp; I have handled
    hundreds of complex personal injury and medical malpractice cases in over 30
    years of practice.&nbsp; In that time, a large number of my cases have gone to
    mediation-many of which were successfully resolved, but some were not.&nbsp; I
    recently had a medical malpractice case mediated by Richard Strauss.&nbsp; He
    was initially recommended by defense counsel, and while that typically would be
    cause for concern, since I had a prior positive experience with Richard, I agreed
    to mediate this case with him.</p>
  <p>Richard was thoroughly prepared for this mediation, having read all of the medical
    and operative reports, expert reports, depositions and other discovery documents.
    &nbsp; He used that preparation to put my clients at ease, knowing he really
    knew the case, and he also proved he knew both the strengths and weaknesses of
    all sides to the case.&nbsp; By demonstrating this in both his opening comments
    when all parties were present, as well as when he met privately with me and my
    clients, he gained a great deal of credibility with me, my clients, and no doubt,
    the defense side.&nbsp; This enabled him to take a very active role in the mediation,
    and he was not simply a messenger of demands and offers, but he was a driving
    force in the negotiating process.&nbsp; I believe this helped all sides examine
    the case fairly and honestly.</p>
  <p>Richard's approach of open discussion was helpful in us getting a complicated
    case, with multiple parties, resolved in a one day mediation session.&nbsp; He
    also recognized that, like all good settlements, all of the parties were both
    a little happy, but also a little unhappy with the outcome-which usually means
    a fair resolution was achieved.&nbsp; It is always gratifying when my client
    gets a good result and understands the process and therefore that this was a
    good result.&nbsp; Richard was instrumental in fostering the atmosphere that
    ended with just that result.</p>
  <p>It is also very impressive that, despite our case not being in his "home jurisdiction",
    Richard was able to understand the nuances of our local law, the relative
    value of a case where the case is venued, and he was also very adept at
    understanding how those factors provided additional strengths or weaknesses for
    the parties.</p>
  <p>In sum, I was very pleased with Richard Strauss as a mediator, and I would
    recommend him to colleagues and use again in other cases.</p>

  <p>I want to take the time to personally thank you again for doing such a great
    job with the mediation last week.&nbsp; Although I had never used your services
    before, I had received excellent feedback and welcomed the opportunity to try
    you as a Mediator.</p>
  <p>I could not have been more satisfied with the mediation and the result you
    achieved fro my client including a very good settlement and an end to protracted
    litigation.&nbsp; I was impressed that you had complete control of the proceeding
    and fully understood all of the facts and legal issues.&nbsp; I was also impressed
    with your willingness to privately give us your opinions on how you viewed the
    evidence and how you thought the issues and trial would play out in court.
    &nbsp; Your medical experience and background in the hospital and rehabilitation
    setting was invaluable.&nbsp; My client and I both respected your opinions and
    appreciated your willingness to provide your insight into the case.&nbsp; With
    you, it was more than just a numbers game and my client felt like he had his
    day in court. I will gladly use your services again.</p>
  <p>Thanks for doing a fine job.</p>

  <p>I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for your assistance in resolving
    my client's significant personal injury claim through mediation.&nbsp; Although
    I must say that I was very tentative at first to utilize your services, given
    your distance from my office in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, that obstacle was quickly
    overcome by your policy of not charging any travel time or expense.</p>
  <p>The concern that I had that you might have a defense preference given your
    prior claims management history was quickly eradicated when we had the opportunity
    to caucus independent of the defendant's counsel and the defendants in our case.
    &nbsp; Similarly, I was very impressed with your grasp of the complicated factual
    history of my client's personal injury matter.&nbsp; I can honestly say that at
    some points I thought you had as solid of a grasp of the facts of my client's case
    as I wielded myself!&nbsp; Your level of preparation was simply exemplary.</p>
  <p>In sum, I can honestly say that I am very happy to have had the opportunity to
    have you mediate this significant and difficult personal injury claim.&nbsp; Not
    only would I recommend you wholeheartedly to other attorneys, I will most assuredly
    keep you in mind for my own future mediation cases in the future.&nbsp; Should any
    of your potential mediation clients have any questions or concerns, you are certainly
    welcome to give them my contact information and I will be more than happy to clarify
    any issues which I am able to.</p>
  <p>I look forward to working with you again in the future.</p>

  <p>I would like to take this opportunity to recommend Richard Strauss, Esq. as a
    mediator in your case.&nbsp; My recommendation is based upon my experience with
    Richard in his role as a mediator in settling a podiatric malpractice case.
    &nbsp; My partner, Adam Rothenberg, Esq., has also had two matters with Richard
    that were successfully settled.</p>
  <p>After those close of discovery in my podiatric malpractice case, defense counsel
    requested mediation but indicated that the carrier would only accept Richard as a
    mediator.&nbsp; The case had been hard fought and relations with defense counsel
    were contentious at times.&nbsp; Richard mediates claims for this carrier in
    multiple states.&nbsp; This request immediately raised a red flag.&nbsp; The
    mediations I have participated in have generally been conducted by retired New
    Jersey Superior Court judges that defense counsel and I have agreed to.&nbsp; My
    limited prior experience with mediations conducted by mediators demanded by
    insurance carriers have not been positive ones.</p>
  <p>I consulted with my partner who advised me that his two experiences with Richard
    had been successful.&nbsp; I checked with my colleagues in the plaintiff's bar and
    Richard also received excellent reviews.&nbsp; My client agreed to the mediation
    with Richard.&nbsp; The paperwork that this mediator requests is modest and focused.
    &nbsp; The submission requires that the plaintiff's lawyer provide a detailed
    analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the case.</p>
  <p>The process that Richard used was appreciated very much by my clients.&nbsp; Richard
    met with plaintiffs and me privately at the outset of the mediation.&nbsp; He
    gave a detailed explanation of the process and answered questions.&nbsp; Richard
    then conveyed a joint meeting of all the parties and counsel to go over the ground
    rules.&nbsp; The next step was to solicit an offer in response to my client's
    pre-mediation demand.&nbsp; Richard went to a separate room to meet with the
    carrier's representative and defense counsel.</p>
  <p>When Richard returned to our conference room, he presented the offer.&nbsp; He
    proceeded to a detailed analysis of the plaintiff's claim and checked with us to
    ensure that he had covered all the points.&nbsp; Richard then explained the
    weaknesses in our position to plaintiffs.&nbsp; He did the presentation in such
    a way as to inform but not offend my clients.&nbsp; I found his analysis to be
    excellent as he pointed out some factors that I had not fully considered and
    evaluated.</p>
  <p>The mediation lasted 3 1/2 hours.&nbsp; Incremental offers were modest and the
    process was painful at times.&nbsp; Richard remained patient and fostered the
    process along step by step.&nbsp; Finally, when positions had narrowed, the
    mediator pushed the parties to a fair resolution of the case.&nbsp; Frankly, I
    was surprised at the outcome and that Richard was able to obtain it.&nbsp; Based
    on my experience, I am certainly willing to use Richard again.</p>

  <p>This letter is in follow-up to our Mediation which occurred on March 27, 2009.
    &nbsp; I want to thank you for your services and professionalism.&nbsp; I was
    more than pleasantly surprised.</p>
  <p>As you can imagine, any time an insurance carrier suggests someone you have
    never heard of to act as&nbsp; mediator, my suspicions are raised.&nbsp; When
    I read that you were a claims manager and worked in the healthcare industry,
    you might imagine the trepidation and suspicion that arose.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
    after speaking on the telephone with you and another plaintiff's attorney, we
    decided to give it "a shot".</p>
  <p>I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; Your preparation,
    knowledge of the facts in our case, understanding of the issues for both parties
    and identification of issues for both parties were as thorough as one could
    possibly expect.&nbsp; The preparation that you did was as good as anyone and
    your insights I thought were very helpful to both parties.</p>
  <p>More importantly, the way in which the Mediation was run from the opening
    through negotiations to conclusion was professional, neutral and consistently
    moved us to the possibility of settlement.&nbsp; While I was satisfied with the
    ultimate number that we actually did settle upon, I believe that even if the
    process had not resulted in settlement I would have been satisfied with the
    services you supplied.</p>
  <p>My clients were comfortable with your approach.&nbsp; You did not pressure us
    and honored my relationship with my clients.&nbsp; Moreover, I appreciate the
    fact that you did not seem to have your own agenda but was always attempting to
    simply move the parties&nbsp;towards a mutual agreement rather than one which
    reflected your own values. </p>
  <p>You have some novel approaches to Mediation.&nbsp; I have recommended you to
    others in my firm and would be willing to recommend you to others.&nbsp; I wish
    you the best and appreciate your fine work in this matter.</p>

  <p> I am writing to express my unqualified recommendation of Richard M. Strauss,
    Esq. as a mediator. </p>
  <p>Recently, Mr. Strauss was instrumental in bringing a resolution to a very
    contentious and complex podiatric malpractice case.&nbsp; He was recommended
    by the insurance carrier's claim representative.&nbsp; I agreed, thinking it
    could not hurt the case to mediate.&nbsp; To my very pleasant surprise, Mr.
    Strauss provided just the help we needed to settle the case.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss
    was evenhanded, exhibited a high degree of expertise in the subject matter, and
    demonstrated am outstanding level of preparation and understanding of the key
    issues in the case. </p>
  <p>This mediator's approach to resolving disputes is unique.&nbsp; In particular,
    his opening comments are specifically directed toward creating a conciliatory
    environment necessary for compromise and resolution.&nbsp; As we proceeded through
    the mediation, Mr. Strauss discussed and thoroughly analyzed each issue in the
    case.&nbsp; Issues evolved and narrowed as the day progressed and Mr. Strauss
    consistently displayed his willingness to offer options and suggestions throughout
    the entire settlement negotiation phase of the mediation. </p>
  <p>Both my client and his daughter, who attended the mediation, told me that they
    were extremely comfortable having Richard M. Strauss mediate the case. </p>
  <p>I was initially concerned, when Mr. Strauss' name was mentioned, about using
    a mediator who is not a New Jersey lawyer.&nbsp; It took only a short amount
    of time before I recognized that Mr. Strauss can mediate effectively in any
    jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>I am happy to recommend Richard M. Strauss and will be pleased to answer any
    questions.</p>

  <p>I am writing this Letter of Recommendation with regard to your services as a
    mediator in the case which settled at mediation recently.&nbsp; When I received
    a request by defense counsel to mediate at the early stages of the case, I thought
    it might be worth a try although I was basically skeptical.&nbsp; I must say I
    was pleasantly surprised.</p>
  <p>Your excellent understanding of nursing home procedures enabled you to point
    out the strengths and weaknesses in both sides positions.&nbsp; Your patient
    ability to communicate with my client was also very helpful in consummating a
    settlement.</p>
  <p>In sum, I highly recommend you as a mediator in this type of case.</p>
