  <h1>New Mexico</h1>
  <hr class="main-hr">

  <p>I am a plaintiff's attorney practicing in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and
    nationally.&nbsp; I have been doing nursing home cases for 17+ years with some
    success.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss has now served as a mediator for me in 2 cases, one
    in New Mexico and one in Nebraska.&nbsp; He is the singularly most prepared
    mediator I have ever met, taking time prior to the mediation to internalize
    both sides of the case in a way I have not seen done by others.&nbsp; This
    preparation makes him a very effective mediator.&nbsp; He is a pleasure,
    personally, and gets along well with clients.&nbsp; I would pass along my
    highest recommendation.&nbsp; Feel free to call or e-mail me with questions.</p>

  <p>With the help of Richard Strauss, we were able to get a substantial settlement
    in a recent medical malpractice action against a doctor and a hospital.&nbsp;
    Mr. Strauss was selected due to his extensive knowledge of medical malpractice
    cases from the defense point of view and knowledge of what these cases are really
    worth.&nbsp; We were very satisfied with the results that were achieved.&nbsp;
    There were additional reasons why we would use Mr. Strauss again.&nbsp; I found
    that since he has a defense-oriented background he understood our issues well,
    and more importantly, he understood the process it would take to gain a satisfactory
    settlement.&nbsp; He understood well that his role was to get the case settled,
    and that was the only way he could maintain his reputation as a successful mediator.
    &nbsp; Other matters that I thought were helpful were that he traveled from Georgia
    at his own expense, without charging any of the parties.&nbsp; Being tenacious,
    beginning in the morning hours and continuing until 8:00 p.m.&nbsp; When part of
    the case did not settle, he continued to push the case for settlement, which
    eventually caused the case to settle all at no additional charge.&nbsp; Coming to
    the mediation knowing the issues and having thoroughly reviewed the documents by
    each side before the mediation, expedited the process.&nbsp; His analysis was
    objective and impartial, identifying risks to both parties.&nbsp; Without hesitation,
    I will be strongly recommending that Mr. Strauss assist us in future mediations.</p>
