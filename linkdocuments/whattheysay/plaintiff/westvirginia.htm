<h2>
<p>I recently had the privilege of conducting a mediation with the services of Mr. Strauss.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss' experience and knowledge in the area of nursing home litigation was a benefit to all involved.&nbsp; I was pleased with his ability to objectively analyze both sides of our case.&nbsp; It is clear that without Mr. Strauss' help and services as mediator we would not have been able to settle this case. </p>
<p>This was my first mediation with Mr. Strauss who was suggested as a mediator by defense counsel.&nbsp; Even though this was my first experience with Mr. Strauss, I feel confident that should I need his services in the future, I will not hesitate to contact him. </p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding Mr. Strauss' ability and effectiveness as a mediator, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
